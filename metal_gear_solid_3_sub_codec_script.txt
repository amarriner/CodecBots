===============================================================================
01) Before you reclaim your backpack in Dremuchij South
===============================================================================

Major Tom: "Snake, first you need to find that backpack you lost on the way
           down. Your backpack got caught on a tree to the north. Try heading
           in that direction."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, you said your backpack got caught on a tree branch, right?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Tom: "Was there ivy growing on the tree?"
Snake: "There was but..."
Major Tom: "Perfect."
Snake: "Perfect?"
Major Tom: "Indeed. You can climb any ivy-covered tree by standing in front
           of the ivy and pressing the Action Button. Climb the tree and
           retrieve your backpack."

===============================================================================
01) Before you reclaim your backpack in Dremuchij South
===============================================================================

Major Tom: "Sokolov should be at the abandoned factory to the north, so head in
           that direction."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, intelligence indicates that that area is outside the enemy's
           cordon. So, you shouldn't have any unexpected encounters with enemy
           patrols. I think it would be a good idea to take this time to get 
           accustomed to using your camouflage, hunting for food, and 
           navigating the Survival Viewer. If you have any questions about
           camouflage or CQC, ask The Boss. The Boss' frequency is 141.80.
           Para-Medic is the medical correspondent for this mission. Ask her
           about hunting for food and medical treatment. Also, she has
           documents detailing flora and fauna in the operation locale. Contact
           her if you need detailed information on any of the plants and 
           animals in your area. Para-Medic's frequency is 145.73."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, remember that this is a solo sneaking mission. We'll be
           providing you with support over the radio, but out in the field,
           you're on your own. There's no backup. And there's no way you'll
           survive a battle with a large enemy contingent. Avoid engagement
           whenever possible. Your highest priority in this mission is staying
           out of sight."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, did you find food?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "You sound happy."
Snake: "I am!"
Para-Medic: "Do you know how to eat it?"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Then let me explain. To eat food, press the START button to enter
            the Survival Viewer, then select FOOD. Select the food you want to
            eat, and press the Enter Button. Select EAT and you will eat the
            selected food. When you eat, you will recover your stamina, but the
            extent of recovery depends on what you eat. When your stamina is 
            down only slightly, you should save your tastier morsels for later.
            But don't leave food for too long, or it'll rot. This is where a
            little planning ahead goes a long way."
Major Tom: "Besides eating food, you can throw it at enemies to confuse them.
           So remember, food is not just for eating! Be creative."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, when your stamina gets low, it negatively affects your
           physical abilities. You've got to replenish your stamina before it
           runs out."
Para-Medic: "The gauge below your Life Gauge is your Stamina Gauge. It shows,
            as the name suggests, your remaining stamina. As you consume 
            stamina, your natural LIFE regeneration is slowed, and your hands
            shake more. Your O2 Gauge and Grip Gauge also become shorter.
            Excessively low stamina can often impede your mission objectives.
            Make sure you replenish stamina before that occurs. Eat food to
            recover stamina. Capture plants and animals to get food. I have
            information on the local plants and animals, so don't hesitate to
            ask. My frequency is 145.73."

---

Major Tom: "Your actions can lower your stamina. The more demanding the
           activity, the more stamina consumed."
Para-Medic: "Exactly. Walking slowly will consume stamina, while actions like
            rolling, crawling, and stalking consume large amounts of it. Try
            your best to avoid unnecessary actions in order to conserve
            stamina."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, use the Survival Viewer to pick your camouflage, treat
           wounds, and eat food. Ask The Boss or Para-Medic about the details.
           The Boss' frequency is 141.80."

---

Snake: "Major."
Major Tom: "What is it?"
Snake: "It's about your code name..."
Major Tom: "Major Tom?"
Snake: "Yeah. Where did you get that name?"
Major Tom: "From a tunnel."
Snake: "A tunnel?"
Major Tom: "That's right. Snake, have you ever seen the movie 'The Great
           Escape'?"
Snake: "No."
Major Tom: "It's a movie about a determined group of allied POWs trapped in a
           German POW camp who plan an escape. The POWs dig three tunnels for
           their escape. They named them Dick, Harry, and Tom."
Snake: "I see. So Tom was an escape tunnel. Did they make it?"
Major Tom: "Out of the camp? Of course. One of the tunnels was even discovered
           before it was finished, but eventually, they do make it out."
Snake: "I get it now. So Tom was the tunnel they used to escape."
Major Tom: "...Uh, yes, that's right."
Snake: "What is it?"
Major Tom: "Mmm, actually, I'm not sure if I remember correctly..."
Snake: "Major..."
Major Tom: "It's all right. It's Tom, Snake, Tom is the escape tunnel. Yes, no
           question about it."
Snake: "..."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, in order to carry out the mission without being spotted, you
           must learn to detect an approaching enemy well ahead of time. Press
           the First Person View Button and use the First Person View to
           constantly check your surroundings as you proceed."
The Boss: "Press the First Person View Button to switch to the First Person 
          View. In First Person View, you can look at the surroundings through
          your own eyes. The Overhead View's range is limited. If you plow 
          ahead using only the Overhead View, you put yourself in danger of
          running into an enemy without even realizing he was there. Make
          regular stops, and check your surroundings with First Person View.
          Okay, Snake?"

---

Major Tom: "You can use an equipped weapon during First Person View. This is
           called a First Person View attack. When using First Person View
           attack, you can direct your line of fire up, down, left or right."
The Boss: "The First Person View attack is a fundamental part of gunfighting.
          It allows you to aim in directions impossible to hit with the
          overhead view like shooting enemies that are above or below you. It
          also makes it possible to aim for your enemies' weak points. When you
          need to take an enemy out in one shot, use a First Person View attack
          and aim for the head."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, making it harder for the enemy to spot you isn't the only
           advantage to maintaining a high Camo index. The harder you are to
           distinguish from your surroundings, the harder you are to hit. In
           other words, the enemy's shots will miss more often. Do everything
           you can to keep your Camo Index high at all times."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, be careful. The way you change between standing, crouching,
           and crawling has changed slightly from the methods learned in
           training. When standing, press the Crawl Button briefly to crouch,
           and press and hold to take a crawling position. Since by crouching
           you take a lower position, it has a higher Camo Index than standing.
           And the added stability of crouching lessens the effect of gun 
           recoil. If you try shooting while crouching, you'll notice your 
           shots will bunch together more consistantly than when standing. 
           Press the Crawl Button while crouching to stand up, and move the 
           left analog stick to crawl in a direction. When crawling, your Camo
           Index becomes extremely high, and your firing of guns becomes even
           more stable than while crouching. You can move the left analog
           stick while on your stomach to crawl in a particular direction. When
           you are crawling, use small movements on the left analog stick to
           crawl silently at the expense of speed. However, be warned that
           crawling consumes more stamina than simply walking. Press and hold
           the Crawl Button while in crawl position to stand up. Press the 
           Crawl Button briefly to switch to crouch position. Don't forget -
           if you want to stand up quickly from a crawling position, press and
           hold the Crawl Button."

---

Major Tom: "Listen up, Snake. Keep in mind that this operation is strictly
           covert. Engagements should be avoided. If you must dispose of an
           enemy, do it with the tranquilizer gun."
Snake: "Yup. Sweet dreams, boy scout."
Major Tom: "That's right. And by the time he wakes up, you and Sokolov will be
           safely out of the country."
Snake: "Sipping hot coffee on a plane back home."
Major Tom: "...What did you say?"
Snake: "?"
Major Tom: "WHAT did you say?"
Snake: "Sipping hot coffee on a..."
Major Tom: "You're going to drink that foul mud? On a victory flight home?"
Snake: "Okay, then what would you drink?"
Major Tom: "Tea, of course!"

Major Tom: "Snake, the fake death and revival pills we gave you are the latest
           in internal medicines developed for intelligence ops by the CIA's
           technology division. You can use the fake death pill to send
           yourself into a death-like state for a limited period of time. Use
           it wisely and you should be able to fool the enemy into thinking
           you're really dead. It may come in handy if you ever find yourself
           cornered. To revive yourself from the fake-death state, use the
           revival pill. But remember - timing is critical. The effect will be
           ruined if you revive yourself right in front of the enemy."
Snake: "Interesting. But how does it work?"
Major Tom: "What do you mean?"
Snake: "I don't feel right about taking some pill I don't know anything about.
       How does it make me look dead? How's it gonna affect my body?"
Major Tom: "Well, Snake...about that..."
Snake: "I get it. I should ask Para-Medic. Para-Medic!"
Para-Medic: "Allow me to explain. You know how there are animals in nature that
            play dead, like weevils, ladybugs, chickadees, opossums and the
            like. Well, the fake death pill takes the natural art of playing
            dead and applies it to the spy world. When you take the fake death
            pill, it causes your body to rapidly secrete a number of chemicals
            - adenosine and serotonin as well as opioid peptides such as 
            methionin enkephalin. Those chemicals act to induce a state of
            hibernation, causing your heart rate, your breathing rate, and your
            body temperature to drop dramatically. It'll truly look like you've
            dropped dead upon initial inspection. The revival pill, to put it
            simply, is a counteracting agent to the fake death pill. When you
            take it, it causes your body to secrete stimulants, like
            noradrenaline and other chemicals such as naloxone, which block the
            effects of the fake death pill. Basically, it wakes you up. Does
            that help?"
Snake: "...Yeah."
Para-Medic: "OK, I'll try to explain it in more detail. The secretion of
            methionin enkaphalin triggered by the fake death pill causes the
            opioid receptors..."
Snake: "O... OK, I think I get it now."
Para-Medic: "You sure?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "But you must want to know a little bit more. There are three types
            of receptors: delta, kappa, and mu. Methionin enkaphalin acts on
            the..."
Major Tom: "Ah, Para-Medic, I think Snake understands now. Isn't that right,
           Snake?"
Snake: "Yeah, clear as crystal."
Para-Medic: "But..."
Snake: "Major, I've got enough info about the pills, so I'm going to get back
       to the mission now."
Major Tom: "Yes. You do that."
Para-Medic: "Hey, wait a--! ..."

Major Tom: "When you're in the jungle, determining the position of your
           enemies is important. That's why you've been supplied with sensors.
           Use them well. The Motion Detector senses activity in your immediate
           vicinity. However, in the jungle, a lot of things other than you are
           moving. Animals moving around will show up on the sensor just like
           anything else. Also, the Motion Detector is only so sensitive. Don't
           forget that certain enemies, and animals, that make only slight
           movements will not be detected. Press the L3 button to initiate the
           active sonar and emit a special sonic wave. The reflected sound from
           the sonic wave reveals the positions of targeted objects. In
           contrast to the Motion Detector, the active sonar reveals still
           objects as well. However, there is a risk that the sound of the
           sonic wave will reveal your position to enemies and animals, so be
           careful when using the active sonar. The Anti-Personnel Sensor
           vibrates when it detects human life forms. Unlike the other sensors,
           the Anti-Personnel Sensor has been adjusted to react to humans only,
           eliminating noise from animal detection. It can detect hidden, 
           unmoving enemies, and the use of it doesn't betray your own 
           position. But on the other hand, its accuracy lacks a bit as it has
           trouble revealing the exact position of detected bodies. Keep that
           in mind. When you use it during First Person View, it will work only
           in the direction you are facing."

---

Major Tom: "Your sensors and other electronic devices cannot be used
           indefinitely. Once they are activated, they consume battery power.
           Remember, all items draw power from a single battery. Once your
           battery runs out, all electronic gear becomes inoperable. You can
           check your remaining battery power with the icon of any item that
           uses electricity. Take care not to waste power. The battery 
           recharges when not in use. When you want to recharge the battery,
           unequip all electronic devices and give it some time. The higher 
           your Stamina Gauge, the faster your battery recharges. If you want
           to recharge faster, eat food and recover your stamina. Also, if you
           run, roll, or do other dramatic actions, the battery will recharge
           faster."
Snake: "Wait a second."
Major Tom: "What is it?"
Snake: "The higher my stamina, the faster my battery recharges?"
Major Tom: "That's what I said."
Snake: "But what does my stamina have to do with the battery?"
Major Tom: "Oh, I see what you're getting at. Let's have Para-Medic explain
           that. Para-Medic?"
Para-Medic: "Yes, sir. It's because Snake's battery uses bioelectricity."
Snake: "Bioelectricity?"
Para-Medic: "Bioelectricity is electricity emitted from cells. When the cells
            of living things are stimulated, sodium and potassium ions move
            rapidly through the cell membrane's ion channel, creating a
            difference in electric potential. The battery uses that energy to
            recharge. So, unless your cells have plenty of nutrients, the
            recharge won't work well."
Snake: "Amazing the kind of machines that are available now..."
Para-Medic: "But this machine has not been made public. It was designed by a
            scientist at the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology."
Snake: "What kind of person was he?"
Para-Medic: "The person who designed it?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "I heard he was pretty strange."
Snake: "Stranger than the Major?"
Para-Medic: "There's nothing strange about the Major."
[In the background, Major Tom's voice is heard:]
Major Tom: "My tea is gone! Who drank it!? How am I supposed to have teatime
           without tea!?"
Para-Medic: "Well, not too strange, at least."
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "Hey, my scone's gone, too!!"

---

Major Tom: "Snake, what do you do when you get a new weapon or item?"
Snake: "I put it in my backpack first."
Major Tom: "But you know that you can't equip items that are still in your
           backpack, right?"
Snake: "Yeah. The only things that can be equipped with the Weapon and Item
       Window Buttons are items on my person."
Major Tom: "Correct. If you want to equip an item, first you have to remove it
           from your backpack."
The Boss: "To place a weapon on your person, go to the Survival Viewer, then
          BACKPACK, then select WEAPON. A list of weapons will be shown in a
          window in the upper left. Select the weapon you wish to put on your
          person with the left analog stick and press the Enter Button to 
          remove the weapon from your backpack and equip it to your person.
          However, you can only carry so many weapons at once on your person.
          Put unnecessary weapons back into your backpack. Select a weapon on
          your person from the weapon list and press the Enter Button to put
          that weapon into your backpack. Your situation determines what
          weapons are most useful. Consider this when choosing which weapons to
          put on your person. Okay, Snake?"

---

Snake: "Major, what kind of place is this secret Design Bureau that Sokolov is
       heading?"
Major Tom: "Mmm. The Soviets have a number of secret Design Bureaus like this
           one, each engaged in cutting-edge research. OKB-1, the bureau where
           the Vostok spacecraft was developed and which plays a leading role
           in the Soviet space program, is one of those installations. Most of
           them are located in secret cities built in isolated areas, and we
           don't even know their exact locations, much less the nature of their
           research. And Sokolov's OKB-754 is the most secret bureau of them 
           all. The intelligence communities of the West have tried time and
           time again to find out what they're working on, but they've failed
           consistently."
Snake: "So you have absolutely no idea what Sokolov is developing?"
Major Tom: "We've got nothing."
Snake: "Then how did you get the information for this mission? It can't have
       been Sokolov..."
Major Tom: "From The Boss."
Snake: "The Boss?"
Major Tom: "That's right. She has her own intelligence channels that she
           cultivated during the last war. She shared what she learned with us.
           That we were able to get the green light for this mission at all is
           thanks to her pull with the powers that be at the CIA. In other
           words, this mission would never have come together without The Boss'
           help in a number of respects."

Major Tom: "Snake, aiming your gun during First Person View is a bit different
           from what you're used to in training."
The Boss: "When you aim your handgun in First Person View, align the front
          sight and the rear sight of the gun with the target, then fire. For
          the assault rifle and certain other weapons, pressing the Weapon 
          Button will first ready the gun for shooting from the hip. If you're
          in a close-quarters fight or other situation that requires immediate
          action, fire from that position. Observe where your shots are
          hitting, and correct your aim accordingly."
Snake: "I understand, but that doesn't sound too accurate."
The Boss: "Of course not. So when you require pinpoint targeting, like when
          firing from afar or sniping, hold the Aim Button to aim. Carefully
          align your front and rear sights to concentrate fire and gain a
          sharper view on your target."

Major Tom: "In the two years since Sokolov's asylum operation, I've spent all
           my time making preparations. And now is the time to show some
           results. FOX is a next-generation espionage organization designed
           to update us for 21st century operations that I proposed to the CIA.
           FOX sends individuals who excel in espionage and special tactics on
           solo sneaking missions like this one... ...A next-generation unit
           that combines the skills of special forces units like the SAS and
           Green Berets with the know-how of an infiltration and espionage
           unit. Military politics was never my strong suit... What I'm trying
           to say is...stealth. This is a stealth mission. Crucial to the
           coming cold war. The CIA director has always frowned upon FOX, but 
           if this mission succeeds, FOX will be added to teh CIA as an
           official unit. I intend to make FOX the leader in special 
           operations. And to that end, this mission must succeed."
Snake: "Right."
Major Tom: "I'm counting on you, Snake."

Major Tom: "Snake, the Soviet troops are not your only enemies."
Snake: "How do you mean?"
The Boss: "Nature..."
Snake: "Boss..."
The Boss: "Poisonous snakes, scorpions, crocodiles, hornets - there are dozens
          of dangerous life forms in Tselinoyarsk. There are even poisonous
          mushrooms and frogs, and other plants and animals you must not eat.
          In order to survive in nature, you have to know nature."
Major Tom: "Para-Medic has information on the flora and fauna in the area. Ask
           her for the details. Para-Medic's frequency is 145.73."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, I don't recommend running around wildly. You need to
           determine when it is best to run, and when it is best to just walk.
           Move the left analog stick slightly to walk. You won't move very 
           fast, but it consumes little stamina, and enemies are less likely
           to detect you. When you are near enemies or when you need to
           conserve stamina, those are good times to walk."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, there are other ways to recover your stamina besides eating.
Snake: "Such as?"
Para-Medic: "Such as taking a rest."
Snake: "A rest?"
Para-Medic: "To take a rest, all you have to do is save and exit the game. The
            next time you load your save data and continue the game, your
            stamina and LIFE will have recovered. How much they recover depends
            on how long of a rest you take."
Snake: "So the longer I rest, the more I'll recover?"
Para-Medic: "That's right. If you're exhausted that you don't even have the
            strength to find food, save the game and take a rest and you'll
            be back on your feet."
Snake: "I hope that never happens."
Para-Medic: "So do I. But you never know. Just don't forget okay?"
Snake: "I won't."

Major Tom: "In most areas outdoors, your footsteps will create some noise even
           if you walk slowly by using small movements of the left analog
           stick. This could alert nearby enemies to your presence. If you need
           to sneak up behind an enemy, use a directional button to utilize
           stalking."
The Boss: "Stalking is a movement technique that eliminates the sound of your
          footsteps. Stalking requires putting your weight on your rear foot,
          then stepping forward slowly with your front foot. Before putting 
          down the front foot, use the tip of your foot to check for dangerous
          objects or branches that might create noise when stepped upon. Once
          you've determined the spot is safe to step on, slowly lower your foot
          to the ground, placing it down from the outside edge first, and then
          slowly lowering your weight onto the foot. Throughout the entire
          process, you have to strain your calves to retain balance."
Snake: "..."
The Boss: "But all you need to do is press the directional button in the 
          direction you wish to move. When stalking, you can move without
          creating sound with your footsteps. And, since your posture is low
          while stalking, you are that much less likely to be spotted by the
          enemy. Since you move cautiously while stalking, you will be able to
          detect a trap on the ground before it is set off. However, the slow,
          concentrated movement while stalking consumes high amounts of
          stamina. Switch between walking and running with the left analog
          stick, and stalking with the directional buttons depending on the
          situation."

Snake: "Major, tell me about Sokolov's past work."
Major Tom: "Mmm. I assume you already know that Sokolov was the developer of
           the multi-engine cluster. The multi-engine cluster is exactly that -
           a system for fitting a single rocket with multiple engines. The
           Vostok rocket, for instance, had 32 engines. With the technology
           they had, it was difficult for the Soviets to develop large engines
           with massive thrust. So instead, they decided to focus on using
           multiple smaller engines to achieve the desired thrust. With this
           method, though, maintaining the fuel balance between the various
           engines was a major problem. Sokolov was the man who provided the
           solution."
Snake: "And that's what earned him the job as head of the Design Bureau?"
Major Tom: "Apparently so."
Snake: "So this secret weapon is some kind of ballistic device?"
Major Tom: "That's my best guess. We don't know for sure, but..."
Snake: "You'll find out soon. As soon as I get Sokolov out of here."
Major Tom: "I'm counting on you."

Major Tom: "With an equipped weapon in overhead view, press and hold the Aim
           Button to lock your line of fire while moving in any given
           direction. Use this for charges or retreats, or any other time that
           you want to concentrate fire in one direction while moving."

---

Major Tom: "The degree to which you move the left analog stick not only changes
           your walking speed, but changes your speed when crawling and for
           instrusion [sic] movement. With large movements of the left analog
           stick, you can move faster, but you'll make noise and give yourself
           away to nearby enemies. With slight movements to the left analog
           stick, you can move in silence. It sacrifices speed, but it's the
           best choice for the times when creating noise presents significant
           risk."

Major Tom: "Part of your mission is to demonstrate to the brass the core
           concepts behind FOX. Leave no evidence. That's the essence of FOX.
           And avoid engagement with the enemy."
Snake: "Understood."
Major Tom: "Not only that. I mean leave NOTHING behind, including weapons,
           equipment, footprints, sweat...even bodily waste."
Snake: "Yeah. When I do my business, I bury it good."
Major Tom: "What!?"
Snake: "What's wrong?"
Major Tom: "That's the American way?"
Snake: "American way for what?"
Major Tom: "To handle defecation. You're going to BURY it?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Tom: "Bring it home with you."
Snake: "What?"
Major Tom: "That's what we did in SAS."
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "The U.S. army is sloppy. They do things well, but not perfectly.
           Here in FOX, we're doing things my way. Got it?"
Snake: "...Yes, sir..."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, if you step in any water or mud, your feet will get wet. If
           you walk like that, you'll leave footprints behind, and the enemy
           may follow them straight to you. Try to avoid walking through any
           water or mud as much as possible. However, if your feet do get wet,
           just crawl to avoid leaving any footprints behind. When you don't
           want anybody following your trail, make sure to crawl."

---

Major Tom: "Equip food as a weapon and press the Weapon Button to throw the
           food. If you want to throw a live animal near an enemy, you may be
           able to distract him. If an enemy is really hungry, he may pounce
           at the prospect of food. You have minimal gear on this mission and
           have to make the most use out of anything you can procure on the
           ground."

Major Tom: "Snake, the Mk22 is a tranquilizer gun. Use it to put enemies to
           sleep without harming them. The speed with which the tranquilizer
           takes effect depends on the point of impact on the enemy. If a
           target is hit on the arm or leg, the tranquilizer won't take effect
           immediately. But a target hit on the head will drop like a fly. If
           you want to take an enemy out in a flash, aim for the head."

---

Snake: "Major, didn't you say that The Boss was in the SAS with you?"
Major Tom: "Yes. We formed the 22nd SAS Regiment together. When the SAS, the
           British Special Air Service, was first established, they invited The
           Boss on board as a special advisor. In fact, you might say that it
           was The Boss who put together Rayforce and L Detachment, which laid
           the groundwork for today's SAS. You won't find her name in any 
           history books, but her contributions were many and great. The real
           heroes are never made public. Not in our line of work, anyway. The
           dummy run on Heliopolis and the nighttime raids on German air bases
           in North Africa were her idea as well. Yes, she was always one step
           ahead of the rest of us, both in thought and action. It's true what
           they say: 'Who Dares, Wins.'"
Snake: "The motto of the SAS."
Major Tom: "Precisely. The motto itself is a tribute to her service. Needless
           to say, the SAS has become a model for special forces unites all
           over the world. In that sense, The Boss really is the mother of
           special forces."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, let me explain the enemy's various states of alert. First
           of all, there's the state in which the enemy in that area doesn't
           know that you're there. This is called Normal Phase. In Normal 
           Phase, the enemy will follow normal procedures for patrols and other
           activities. They won't present much of a danger to you. But if they
           spot an intruder - that means you - they'll attack in an attempt to
           neutralize you. This is called Alert Phase. Alert Phase will last
           until the enemy loses sight of you. Even after they lose sight of
           you, the enemy will continue to search the area for a while. This
           is called Evasion Phase. Evasion Phase will last until the enemy
           exhausts their search effort. Once Evasion Phase is over, the enemy
           should return to base. After the search is aborted, the enemy will
           enter Caution Phase. In Caution Phase, enemy soldiers will be more
           cautious in their patrols, and they'll likely be more difficult to
           detect. In addition to the regular patrols, there's also a chance 
           that they'll send out additional search units. Keep on your toes."

---

Major Tom: "After you've grabbed an enemy from behind with CQC, you can
           interrogate him by pressing the L3 button. This is an opportunity
           to gain intelligence. Some of your enemies have valuable 
           information, so give the technique a try, and see what you can
           learn."

---

Major Tom: "Press the Crawl Button during a run to commence a roll. For a brief
           interval you will perform a jump which can be used to knock down
           enemies. In contrast to the training you've done so far, you can use
           rolling to jump waist-high objects. However, remember that rolling
           consumes more stamina than standard running."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, remember that the suppressor is a limited commodity."
Snake: "I know. No suppressor lasts forever."
Major Tom: "Exactly. When the suppressor's durability wears away, it breaks
           beyond repair. See the weapon icon to check the suppressor's present
           level of durability. Remove the suppressor from your gun if you want
           to make it last. Select the weapon that the suppressor is on with
           the Weapon Window Button, and press the Enter Button to attach or
           detach the suppressor. Regular usage of the suppressor based on the
           situation."

Snake: "Major, what about my code name?"
Major Tom: "You mean, Naked Snake?"
Snake: "Yeah. What does it mean?"
Major Tom: "It's because snakes slither through the grass, unnoticed to those
           around them..."
Snake: "No, I mean the 'naked' part."
Major Tom: "It means without embellishment, devoid of a specified quality - in
           other words, basic."
Snake: "Why's that my code name?"
Major Tom: "I explained that the Virtuous Mission is designed to test the
           effectiveness of FOX, right?"
Snake: "Right."
Major Tom: "And the procedure used for this mission will represent the modus
           operandi of FOX for future missions. In other words..."
Snake: "The essence of FOX, naked and pure?"
Major Tom: "Exactly. And there's the fact that you went in practically naked -
           no weapons, no equipment."
Snake: "I see. Means more than I realized."
Major Tom: "Yes, clever isn't it? But don't leave yourself naked to the enemy."
Snake: "Roger that."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, certain enemies are equipped with radios. These signalers
           can use their radios to transmit information to and from the command
           headquarters. If a signaler realizes your presence, you can be he'll
           be on the horn calling backup from headquarters. After headquarters
           receives the call for backup, they contact a nearby unit and order
           them to head over and give support. Once backup arrives, your
           enemies will outnumber you beyond hope for victory. It'll be too 
           much for even you to handle. If you notice a signaler making a call
           for backup with his radio, take him out before he has the chance. If
           the call gets through, retreat before the backup unit arrives. If
           you hang around too long, you'll find yourself immensely outmatched.
           Got it?"

---

Major Tom: "It's possible to destroy the radio that enemy correspondents use.
           If you must get involved in a fight, destroying the radio first will
           allow you to concentrate on the battle without worrying about
           reinforcements."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, this mission is a sneaking mission. You'll be doing your job
           right under the enemy's nose. In the event that you are spotted by 
           an enemy, disable him before he can alert nearby soldiers. If you 
           can take him out before he alerts other enemies of your presence,
           then the Alert Phase will quickly be restored to Normal Phase. But
           don't forget - even this should only happen in emergencies. Your top
           priority is to avoid being spotted by the enemy in the first place.
           Be effective."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, I recommend against leaving the bodies of your victims lying
           around. If the enemy spots a fallen comrade, they will realize that
           they have been infiltrated, and strengthen their guard. When you
           kill an enemy, hide the body in the grass or at some other location
           where it won't be spotted. Stand near a fallen enemy and press the
           Weapon Button with no weapon equipped to grab the body. Hold the
           Weapon Button and move to drag the body. Release the Weapon Button
           to put the body down."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, the damage that an enemy takes from your gun depends on 
           where you hit him. If you hit an arm or leg, one shot won't be
           enough to finish him. If you want to take an enemy out in one shot,
           you have to use a First Person View attack and get a solid shot to
           the head."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, I've completed the double-check on the Fulton Recovery
           System."
Snake: "Any problems?"
Major Tom: "None. Leave your recovery to us."
Snake: "Excellent."
Major Tom: "I suppose I should explain the procedure once more before the
           actual maneuver?"
Snake: "No..."
Major Tom: "I see. Well, the Fulton recovery system allows for rapid recovery
           of personnel from enemy territory, and is perfect for these kinds of
           special operations."
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "Basically how it works is the plane flies by and snags a nylon lift
           line that the soldier has grabbed onto and that has been elevated by
           a balloon. The Fulton recovery system was first designed in the 
           1940s as a method of picking up mail for the American postal
           service. During the Korean war, that system was redesigned to
           recover personnel. JACK, an ancillary organization to the CIA... 
           Yes, good ol' JACK...It stands for Joint Advisory Commission, Korea.
           Isn't that something?"
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "So, JACK first used the Fulton Surface-To-Air Recovery System to
           extract agents from North Korea and mainland China. Let's go over
           the procedure once more - to be on the safe side. First, the plane
           drops a canister about the size of a coffin to you. Inside, you'll
           find a balloon, a 1500-foot cable, and a harness that attaches to 
           your suit. Take the items out, attach a line to your suit, fill the
           balloon with helium, and send the line up. The plane will approach
           at 125 miles per hour, snag the cable just below the balloon with a
           hook on the nose of the aircraft, and whisk you away. Assuming the
           pickup is successful, you'll be reeled in with a winch, and pulled
           to safety into the rear of the aircraft. Got it?"
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "Snake?"
Snake: "Yeah, I got it. I got it real good."
Major Tom: "Were you listening?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Tom: "Alright then."

Major Tom: "You can get inside trees that are hollowed out from decay. Entering
           a hollow is an effective method of gaining temporary cover from
           enemies. However, if you're caught entering the tree, you'll take
           concentrated fire. If they throw a grenade in on you, you'll be torn
           to shreds. Be careful."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, when you stand up against a tree or put your back against 
           the wall near a corner, the camera lowers and gives you a view of
           behind. This is the Corner View. This allows you to keep track of
           what's occuring behind you when hiding in protected areas. Also,
           there are a variety of actions possible while hiding, including 
           using the Left and Right Step Buttons to peek, and the Weapon Button
           to take jumpout shots. Learning how to take advantage of Corner View
           is the first step forward to mission success. Use it to your utmost
           advantage."

---

Major Tom: "In the Corner View, press the Left Step Button or the Right Step
           Button to stick yourself out from a protected area and look over
           your shoulder. We'll call this action peeking. Peeking is effective
           for observation, since it gives you a wider range of vision than the
           normal Corner View. However, since it involves revealing part of 
           your body, you put yourself at risk of being spotted by the enemy."

---

Major Tom: "Move the right analog stick with the Corner View on to shift the
           camera in that direction. This won't give you the same wide angle
           as peeking with the Left and Right Step Buttons, but it is safer
           since it will keep you from exposing your body too much. You'll do
           well to get accustomed to it."

---

Major Tom: "If you have a gun equipped during the Corner View, press the Weapon
           Button to jump out and take a jumpout shot. With the jumpout shot
           technique, you can stay protected from enemy fire behind an
           obstruction, and launch a burst attack when the time is right. This
           is a crucial technique for firefights. Use it well."

---

Major Tom: "By equipping grenades and pressing the Weapon Button in corner view
           mode, you can throw a grenade while hiding behind a barrier. This
           technique should comein handy during a firefight. Use it well."

Major Tom: "You did an excellent HALO jump."
Snake: "Not really. I didn't land in the right spot."
Major Tom: "A jumper who lost his pack on the first real HALO jump - that'll
           make a good story for you."
Snake: "Who cares? There are no records of your operations."
Major Tom: "I know, but..."
Snake: "What, you're embarrassed?"
Major Tom: "No, I'm not embarrassed."
Snake: "It's The Boss, isn't it?"
Para-Medic: "What about The Boss?"
Snake: "Nothing, Para-Medic."
Para-Medic: "Doesn't sound like nothing."
Snake: "Nothing to do with The Boss, I mean."
Para-Medic: "It has something to do with The Boss, but you don't want to say
            so?"
Snake: "...Yeah, kinda..."
Para-Medic: "...I understand, Snake. The Boss has done a lot of work on the
            military study of HALO jumps. And Snake here wanted to give a
            perfect performance on the first real jump, you know, to show
            respect to the mother of the technique."
Snake: "Major!"
Major Tom: "Snake!? I thought you were over and out?"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Wow, is that right?"
Snake: "You got something to say?"
Para-Medic: "No."
Snake: "I bet you do."
Para-Medic: "Not really. I just think it's kinda sweet of you to think like
            that."
Snake: "I don't know whether to take that as a compliment, or an insult."
Para-Medic: "It's a compliment, Snake! So tell me, is it true?"
Snake: "What!?"
Para-Medic: "Not that. Is it true that The Boss really worked on research for
            HALO jumps?"
Snake: "Oh, that..."
Major Tom: "Yes, it's true. HALO stands for High Altitude, Low Opening. It's a
           jump technique developed for covert insertions into enemy territory,
           just like the area you're in. A plane flies at 10,000 feet or above
           to avoid detection by ground forces, and the jumper freefalls until
           he's within a 1000-foot radius above the target area, when he
           finally opens his chute. By using this technique, the chances of
           revealing the parachute landing to the enemy are marginal. The HALO
           technique was originally developed in France. This was partly due to
           popularity of parachuting as a sport since the end of World War II.
           And The Boss was an instructor for the research that was carried out
           there. In 1957 at the JFK Special Operations Center at Fort Bragg,
           The Boss was invited to instruct at the first ever U.S. Military
           HALO School. Of course, none of this is on the record. But she's
           the mother of modern-day special forces."

Major Tom: "Press the Action Button when you are on top of a branch or in front
           of a railing to hang down from that spot. This action is called
           hanging. Sometimes it is advantageous to move while hanging rather
           than walking on the surface. Also, by hanging, you can hide by 
           staying out of the sight of your enemies."

---

Major Tom: "While hanging, use the left analog stick, Left Step Button, and
           Right Step Button to move left and right. When you want to climb
           back up from your hanging position, press the Action Button once
           more. If you want to drop down, press the Crawl Button."

---

Major Tom: "You can't keep hanging forever. Once you run out of grip strength,
           you'll fall. Check your grip strength with the Grip Gauge. When you
           hang, a blue gauge appears above the Stamina Gauge. This is the Grip
           Gauge. It indicates the status of your grip. When hanging, the Grip
           Gauge drops. When the Grip Gauge expires, you will fall. So you must
           climb back up before that happens. The length of the Grip Gauge
           depends upon your stamina. If you need to hang for a long period,
           you'll have to revive your stamina first."

---

Major Tom: "If there's something to grab onto during a fall, press the Action
           Button when you pass in front of it. If you get the timing right,
           you'll be able to grab and hang onto that area. With this technique,
           you can reach locations that are inaccessible by other means. You
           may even find some rare items this way. Observe your geographic
           surroundings, and try to find spots that you could grab during a
           fall."

---

Major Tom: "Press the Crawl Button while hanging to drop straight down. You can
           known an enemy instantly unconscious with this technique if you land
           on top of him. When you're in a tree, try aiming for an enemy
           passing beneath."

---

Major Tom: "Press the Action Button from on top of a branch to hang down from
           the tree. But you can only remain hanging as long as your grip
           strength lasts. Keep an eye on your Grip Gauge when dangling from a
           tree. Be careful -- with low stamina, your grip won't last long."
The Boss: "Even while hanging, you can fire your handgun with one arm. And if
          you are attacked during a hanging maneuver, don't panic and claim
          the advantage."

---

Major Tom: "If you approach an enemy undetected, you can render him defenseless
           by jutting a gun into his body from behind. This is called a holdup.
           However, even after rendering an enemy defenseless, if he notices
           you put your weapon away or start to walk away, he will attack. So,
           be careful. When you hold an enemy up, sometimes he will give you an
           item. Conducting a holdup presents risks, but it is a useful
           technique when you are running low on ammunition or medical items.
           After you have received an item from a hold up [sic], you might try
           holding the enemy up again. He might give up a more precious, hidden
           item."

Snake: "Major, tell me a little more about the space race."
Major Tom: "In 1957, the Soviet Union succeeded in launching their first
           artificial satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. Having been beaten to the
           chase by the Soviets, the U.S. government accelerated its own space
           program in an effort to catch up. The following year, the space
           development programs of the various service branches were united to
           form the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA. 
           That same year, the Mercury program was launched with the goal of
           putting a man into space. Seven candidates were chosen from the 
           military as the first astronauts. These were the men with the 'right
           stuff.' But as you know, it was a Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, 
           who made the first successful manned space flight three years ago.
           NASA's first successful ballistic flight came one month after 
           Gagarin's mission, with the Freedom 7 carrying Alan Shepherd into
           space. After that, with America still lagging behind the Soviets in
           orbital flight, President Kennedy made a momentous decision. That
           America would put a man on the moon before the end of the decade."
Snake: "Yeah, I heard that speech. But a lot of guys I knew weren't real happy
       about it... They said no one was gonna make them go on a mission to blow
       up some damn moon base."
Major Tom: "But rocket research and missile research are closely related. 
           Imagine, if you will, a Soviet Union able to send wave after wave of
           nuclear missiles raining down on Washingtom from a base on the 
           surface of the moon. Even if that's still a long way from reality...
           If we lose the initiative, we may never get it back. We're left with
           no choice but to keep moving forward, one step at a time. The Gemini
           program launched two years ago represents the initial step forward
           establishing a moon base."
Snake: "And yet... I don't want to call President Kennedy a liar, but I simply
       can't imagine that in six years, man will have reached the moon. I don't
       know. I never even thought we'd make it up into space. Guess it all 
       depends on whether you have the will to make it happen."
Major Tom: "Perhaps you're right."

---

Major Tom: "You can climb up onto waist-high objects by pressing the Action
           Button. Climbing can get you to locations that can't be accessed by
           walking, and it may help you reach items that can't be found 
           normally. Don't forget to try climbing things."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, press the left analog stick down on the Radio Screen to
           open the Memory Window. In the Memory Window, select a person to
           contact and press the Enter Button. This saves you the time of
           adjusting the frequency. The battlefield airwaves are littered with
           various transmissions. You can find a real catch if you fiddle 
           around enough."

---

Major Tom: "Press the CQC Button when you are up against a wall to knock on the
           wall and make a sound. Creating sounds can attract the attention of
           enemies. There are many ways to use sound to your advantage. Use it
           to lure an enemy in the wrong direction, then use that opportunity
           to slip by. Or, lure an enemy near you, then ambush the enemy from
           behind. Use it to your utmost advantage."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, if you find an item box, use First Person View to take a
           good look and find out what's inside. Sometimes it's dangerous to
           blindly go after an item. That's why you should check first to make
           sure the item in the box is worth the trouble. If you can't get a
           good look, you can use your binoculars."

---

Major Tom: "When you press the Weapon Button with the handgun, you aim, and 
           when you release it, you fire. If, after aiming, you wish to 
           withdraw your aim without firing, release the Weapon Button slowly.
           You'll just have to practice until you get the hang of it. I've 
           heard a lot of cases where fresh recruits accidentally fired on
           enemies during a holdup. If you train yourself now, you won't be
           liable to miss when the pressure's on. If you're unsure of yourself,
           you should practice."

---

Major Tom: "The assault rifle works a little differently from the handgun.
           Press the Weapon Button lightly to aim, and press the Weapon Button
           fully to fire. If you want to lower the weapon without firing, such
           as during a holdup, just release the Weapon Button without fully
           pressing it. Be careful not to fire the weapon the moment you aim."

---

Major Tom: "The distance that you throw grenades and other throwable weapons
           is determined by how hard you press the Weapon Button. A light press
           of the Weapon Button will toss the weapon nearby, while a hard press
           will hurl it further. Adjust the strength of the button press as
           appropriate. You can also throw in First Person View. With this
           view, you can throw more accurately at specific targets. Use it as
           necessary."

---

Major Tom: "In First Person View, use the Right Step Button to take one step
           right, and the Left Step Button to take a step left. Use it to 
           attack while hiding behind barriers and to step out of hidden spots
           to scout."

---

Major Tom: "During First Person View, press the Left and Right Step Buttons at
           the same time to stretch up slightly from that position. It's useful
           when you are hiding behind barriers and scouting or in a shoot-out."

---

Major Tom: "When you creep inside of a small space, the Overhead View switches
           to the Intrusion View. Movement during the Intrustion View is a bit
           different from movement during the Overhead View. Use up on the left
           analog stick to advance, down to go backwards, and left and right to
           rotate. Use directional button left and right to shift left and
           right. With large movements of the left analog stick, you move 
           faster, but create sound. Nearby enemies might notice you. With
           slight movements of the left analog stick, you can move without 
           making a sound, but at the expense of speed. Use both types of
           movement in appropriate situations."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, did you notice that when you knock an enemy unconscious,
           stars appear over his head? If you take a close look at the stars
           above the enemy's head, you'll notice that they disappear gradually,
           one at a time. Once the stars are all gone, the enemy becomes
           conscious again, and returns to battle. So, when you knock out an
           enemy, be sure to plan for his recovery."

---

Major Tom: "Each time you use up the ammunition in a magazine, you'll need to
           load the next one. You'll be vulnerable while changing magazines, so
           always be aware of your remaining bullets. Remaining bullets are
           displayed in an icon. You may want to carry out a tactical reload
           before the magazine is fully used."
The Boss: "A tactical reload is a change of magazines carried out before the
          bullets in the magazine are completely used up. It keeps you from
          running out of bullets near your enemies, so that you can keep up 
          your level of firepower, and you will always have a bullet in your
          chamber. The trick is: don't lower your gun or your line of sight
          when reloading. Keep your line of sight and concentrate on your
          surroundings while changing magazines. And don't forget to retrieve
          magazines that still have bullets remaining in them. The actual
          procedure involves unequipping your gun, and then equipping it again.
          That will load the gun with a new magazine. I recommend pressing the
          Weapon Window Button quickly to carry out a quick reload."

---

Major Tom: "When you're out in nature, you'll find lots of places that you can
           crawl inside. You can use those places to hide from enemies. You'd
           be a fool not to take advantage of those hiding places. So always
           look around with First Person View, and survey your surroundings."

Major Tom: "Snake, are you wearing that mask again?"
Snake: "Yeah. For some reason is feels kind of...nostalgic."
Major Tom: "Yeah well... for some reason I don't like it."
Snake: "Why not?"
Major Tom: "Something about that face just rubs me the wrong way."
Snake: "It looks fine to me... but if you hate it that much, why did you give 
       it to me in the first place?"
Major Tom: "Well... that mask was originally created for use in another
           mission. An agent was supposed to disguise himself as a Soviet 
           officer and sneak into an enemy installation. We had it all set to
           go, but certain circumstances forced us to abort the mission. With 
           the mission cancelled, the mask was going to be thrown away... but 
           the guy at the CIA's tech division who created it pitched a fit..."
Snake: "Why'd he do that?"

Major Tom: "He said it was too good to throw away."
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "According to him, that mask is a revolutionary new design that lets
           the wearer blink, something that wasn't possible up until now."
Snake: "I'd think you'd want to make the lips move before bothering with the 
       blinking."
Major Tom: "Yeah, I thought so too, but for some reason he's obsessed with
           making it blink..."
Snake: "Whoever he is, he sounds like a crackpot."
Major Tom: "Mmm. Well, he does good work. But I spend three days a month just
           dealing with the complaints we get about him... Ah, well, never 
           mind... Anyway, I decided to put this mask we had in storage to 
           good use by hiding your identity from the gunship crew."
Snake: "I get it... so this mask is based on a model somewhere."
Major Tom: :That's right."
Snake: "What do I do if I meet that guy?"
Major Tom: "That's not going to be a problem."
Snake: "Why not?"
Major Tom: The man the mask is based on is a GRU officer. You're in the 
           KGB's sphere of influence. Chances are you won't run into him."
Snake: "If I do?"
Major Tom: "Beat the crap out of him."

Para-Medic: "I see you caught yourself a Reticulated Python. The Reticulated
            Python is said to be the longest snake in the world. The biggest
            ones can grow up to 10 meters in length. Although they're not
            poisonous, they're still very dangerous, so be careful around them.
            They have a highly ferocious temperament, and they can swallow 
            whole even large animals like deer and pigs. Their most 
            distinguishing feature is the mesh pattern of their scales. This
            pattern acts as a highly effective natural camouflage. If you think
            there might be a Reticulated Python about, pay close attention to
            your surroundings. Otherwise you could get bitten before you even
            know it's there. It's a huge snake, but you should be able to 
            capture it alive by using the tranquilizer gun. I'll bet if you
            capture one and throw it at an enemy, it'll give him a good scare."
Snake: "Right. But - how do they taste?"
Para-Medic: "Huh?"
Snake: "Do they taste good?"
Para-Medic: "You're actually going to eat one?"
Snake: "Why else would I be asking?"
Para-Medic: "Cannibal."
Snake: "What was that?"
Para-Medic: "Nothing. Let's see what the guide says... Ah, you're in luck. It
            says they taste pretty good."
Snake: "Good. I can hardly wait."
Para-Medic: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is inhabited by the Giant Anaconda. The Giant
            Anaconda is believed to be the largest snake in the world in terms
            of weight and diameter. It's not poisonous, but its large size
            makes it extremely powerful. They say it even eats crocodiles. Its
            only natural predator is man."
Snake: "And snake."
Para-Medic: "...And snake. The Giant Anaconda is a very large snake, but you
            should be able to capture it alive using the tranquilizer gun."
Snake: "Got it. So how does it taste?"
Para-Medic: "I knew you were going to ask me that."
Snake: "Glad I didn't disappoint you. So?"
Para-Medic: "Well, the guide says it tastes all right..."
Snake: "Good. I'll have to try some."
Para-Medic: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is inhabited by Magpies. Magpies are members of
            the crow family. They're distinguishable by their beautiful dark
            blue and white bodies and their long tails. Their favorite food is
            insects, but they'll also eat small fish, acorns, and fruit. 
            They're omnivores, which means..."
Snake: "They'll eat anything."
Para-Medic: "Right. Just like you, huh. If you use the tranquilizer gun, you
            should be able to capture Magpies alive."
Snake: "Okay. So, how do they taste?"
Para-Medic: "You always ask me that."
Snake: "Naturally. So?"
Para-Medic: "I've never heard of anybody actually eating a Magpie, but I 
            suppose there's no reason you couldn't."
Snake: "You don't say."
Para-Medic: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area should be inhabited by Tree Frogs. The Tree Frog
            is a green frog that's found throughout Asia. Its arboreal, 
            spending most of its time in shrubs and bushes. Use the 
            tranquilizer gun to catch one alive. I bet you could scare an 
            enemy good if you toss one at him. But the tree frogs that live in
            that jungle are a lot bigger than ordinary tree frogs."
Snake: "They've got a good appetite, huh?
Para-Medic: "You've got a one-track mind, don't you. But seriously, that is one
            theory. However, there are people who think it's a mutation caused
            by nuclear testing and waste from the research facility."
Snake: "Do you think they're safe to eat?"
Para-Medic: "Is that all you ever think about?"
Snake: "What else is there?"
Para-Medic: "Lots."
Snake: "Like what?"
Para-Medic: "Like why a frog would get so big in the first place. Whether it's
            a temporary phenomenon caused by a unique environment, or a 
            permanent mark of evolution, or a product of the toxic waste coming
            out of the research facility. If it is the waste that's causing it,
            then it means humans are interfering with the ecosystem. It really
            makes you think about the changing relationship between..."
Snake: "This isn't interesting."
Para-Medic: "Oh fine, be that way..."
Snake: "So? How is it?"
Para-Medic: "You mean is it edible?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "Hmm. I guess it's probably OK..."
Snake: "Probably?"
Para-Medic: "I don't know. The guide doesn't say anything."
Snake: "Pretty useless guide if you ask me."
Para-Medic: "Well, try one for dinner and you can help improve it."

Para-Medic: "The gauge below your Life Gauge is your Stamina Gauge. It shows,
            as the name suggests, your remaining stamina. As you consume 
            stamina, your natural LIFE regeneration is slowed, and your hands
            shake more. Your O2 Gauge and Grip Gauge also become shorter.
            Excessively low stamina can often impede your mission objectives.
            Make sure you replenish stamina before that occurs."

Para-Medic: "You should be able to find Russian Oyster Mushrooms in that area.
            The Russian Oyster Mushroom is an edible variety that belongs to
            the Shimeji family. It's known to be particularly rich in vitamin
            B1 and Niacin. Apparently, it's usually found growing on tree 
            stumps and hollow logs. So look there if you want to eat some."

Para-Medic: "I see you have a Calorie Mate."
Snake: "Calorie Mate?"
Para-Medic: "The thing you're holding now."
Snake: "Oh, the little block that looks like a cookie?"
Para-Medic: "Try it. It's pretty good."
Snake: "Okay. But what is this thing? I've never seen anything like it."
Para-Medic: "Calorie Mate is an energy supplement that contains all the 
            proteins, liquids, vitamins, carbohydrates and minerals needed for
            a balanced diet. It is a well-balanced food. Because of that, it's
            just perfect for giving your body the nutrition it needs in
            combat."
Snake: "It sounds like a space-age food."
Para-Medic: "Real astronaut food is not very good, but that should taste fine."
Snake: "Yeah, and it will help balance out all this jungle food I'm eating."
Para-Medic: "It's easy and quick to eat, so it's perfect for when you are 
            running late for an important mission in the morning."
Snake: "I've never been late for a mission."
Para-Medic: "Really? Aren't you always keeping people waiting?"
Snake: "?"
Para-Medic: "It's easy to keep track of your calorie intake and receive the
            nutrition your body needs, so it's good for losing weight too. All
            of the geisha girls in Japan use it for watching their calories."
Snake: "Is that why they're all so slim?"
Para-Medic: "Right. And any diet where you eat nothing at all is bad for the
            body."
Snake: "I see. You seem to know a lot about Japan don't you?"
Para-Medic: "Yes, I love Japan."

Para-Medic: "You should be able to find Siberian Ink Cap mushrooms growing in
            that area. The Siberian Ink Cap is a mushroom from the ink cap
            family. Its life cycle is transitory. As soon as the spores mature,
            the cap starts to turn black, liquefy, and melt away."
Snake: "And that's why they call it an ink cap?"
Para-Medic: "That's right. It doesn't really turn into liquid, but you get the
            idea. In its immature state - before it melts away - it's valued as
            a source of food. Just be sure not to eat them while you're 
            drinking alcohol."
Snake: "Why's that?"
Para-Medic: "Ink caps contain coprin, which inhibits the function of aldehyde
            dehydrogenase. This prevents the body from breaking down alcohol,
            causing a buildup of acetaldehyde."
Snake: "...Meaning?"
Para-Medic: "Meaning it will give you the hangover from hell."
Snake: "Oh."
Para-Medic: "Wait a minute..."
Snake: "What? You think I'd drink alcohol in the middle of a mission?"
Para-Medic: "Wouldn't you?"
Snake: "Hell no."
Para-Medic: "Well, I'm kicking a shot back now."
Snake: "What!?"
Para-Medic: "Just teasing you."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Oh, come on, where's your sense of humor?"
Snake: "...I need a drink..."

Para-Medic: "A fruit called the Russian False Mango grows in that area. The
            Russian False Mango is a mango-like fruit found only in
            Tselinoyarsk. The egg-shaped fruit is sweet and tangy with a
            pleasing aroma; just like a mango. Also, the seeds can be used to
            make a medicine that aids in digestion. It might come in handy if
            you ever get an upset stomach."

Para-Medic: "I see you caught yourself a Reticulated Python. The Reticulated
            Python is said to be the longest snake in the world. They're not
            venomous, but they're still dangerous, so watch out."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is inhabited by the Giant Anaconda. The giant
            anaconda is said to be the largest snake in the world in terms of
            weight and thickness. It's not venomous, but its huge size makes it
            dangerous. Be careful."

Para-Medic: "Eat food to recover stamina. Capture plants and animals to get
            food. I have information on the local plants and animals, so don't
            hesitate to ask."

Para-Medic: "To take a rest, all you have to do is save and exit the game. The
            next time you load your save data and continue the game, your
            stamina and LIFE will have recovered. How much they recover depends
            on how long of a rest you take."
Snake: "So the longer I rest, the more I recover?"
Para-Medic: "That's right. If you're so exhausted that you don't even have the
            strength to find food, save the game and take a rest and you'll be
            back on your feet."
Snake: "I hope that never happens."
Para-Medic: "So do I. But you never know. Just don't forget okay?"
Snake: "I won't."

---

Para-Medic: "To eat food, press the START button to enter the Survival Viewer,
            then select FOOD. Select the food you want to eat, and press the
            Enter Button. Select EAT and you will eat the selected food. When
            you eat, you will recover your stamina, but the extent of recovery
            depends on what you eat. When your stamina is down only slightly,
            you should save your tastier morsels for later. But don't leave 
            food for too long, or it'll rot. This is where a little planning
            ahead goes a long way."

Snake: "Para-Medic."
Para-Medic: "What's up?"
Snake: "Are you a medic, or a doctor?"
Para-Medic: "I'm a well-respected physician. Or I was, until I joined the CIA."
Snake: "How was your reputation?"
Para-Medic: "My what?"
Snake: "Your reputation."
Para-Medic: "Oh, that."
Snake: "How was it?"
Para-Medic: "Why? Don't you trust me?"
Snake: "That's not what I meant."
Para-Medic: "Fine, then."
Snake: "Mm hmm. ...So?"
Para-Medic: "So what?"
Snake: "Your reputation - how was it?"
Para-Medic: "My! You're relentless!"
Snake: "Hey, I'm a snake. So?"
Para-Medic: "My reputation was spotless. I'm highly skilled, patient, and good-
            -looking to boot. Everybody wanted to see me. What else would you
            expect?"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "No, seriously."
Major Tom: "Incidentally, her nickname back then was 'Quack'."
Para-Medic: "Major!"
Snake: "...Is that true?"
Para-Medic: "Mm? Is what true?"
Snake: "About your nickname."
Para-Medic: "No! ...Well, maybe a few people did call me that..."
Snake: "So you were a quack?"
Para-Medic: "No! ...Well, yes and no. I mean, in a sense I was, but then again
            I wasn't..."
Snake: "???"
Major Tom: "Snake, her skills as a doctor are beyond reproach. You have my word
           on that."
Para-Medic: "Yes! That's exactly what I was trying to say, Snake."
Snake: "Then why did they call her 'Quack'?"
Major Tom: "It's because she..."
Para-Medic: "Never mind that! It doesn't matter. We've got a job to do, and we
            have to stay focused. Besides, my past doesn't have anything to do
            with the mission and..."
Snake: "Because she never shuts up?"
Major Tom: "Yes, that's it."
Para-Medic: "No, that's not it! Snake, tell him that's not true!"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Say something!"
Snake: "I'd better get back to the mission."
Major Tom: "Yes, you do that."
Para-Medic: "Just a minute! Snake! Don't you hang up on me!"

---

Para-Medic: "If you have any questions about stamina or healing, just ask me.
            I'll tell you everything you need to know. It'll have to be over
            the radio, though."
Snake: "So you won't be able to see me naked, then."
Para-Medic: "Yeah, I'm devastated. But I'll bet that 50 years from now, you'll
            be able to see who you're talking to on the radio."
Snake: "I'll be retired from active duty by then."
Para-Medic: "I don't know. Somebody somewhere might just decide to give you a
            call."
Snake: "Wouldn't surprise me. Let's both pray that never happens."

Para-Medic: "Say, Snake, about that helmet and oxygen mask you took off right
            after you parachuted in..."
Snake: "Oh, those? Those are the helmet assembly and oxygen system assembly I
       used to make the HALO jump. The helmet is fitted with a bayonet fastener
       that attaches to the oxygen mask. It's also got earphones and a boom
       mike..."
Para-Medic: "I'm not interested in that stuff."
Snake: "So why did you bring it up?"
Para-Medic: "It reminds me of something."
Snake: "Reminds you of something?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah."
Snake: "The mask?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. But I can't remember what it is, and I can't stop thinking
            about it..."
Snake: "...That's what you've been thinking about?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. Every time I'm about to remember it, it slips away from me
            again. Don't you just hate that?"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "I know I've seen it somewhere before...any ideas?"
Snake: "How would I..."
Para-Medic: "That's it!"
Snake: "What!?"
Para-Medic: "The Fly!"
Snake: "The Fly?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah, it finally came to me. You looked just like him. Aah, I feel
            better..."
Snake: "...The Fly?"
Para-Medic: "From the movie 'The Fly'. You've never seen it?"
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "Geez, where have you been? It's about this scientist who's
            conducting teleportation experiments when he gets mixed up with a
            fly and ends up with the fly's head attached to his body."
Snake: "Never heard of it."
Para-Medic: "That's too bad... It's a good movie..."

Para-Medic: "When you get hurt, your body will heal itself naturally over time.
            However, the speed at which your LIFE recovers depends on how much
            stamina you have at the time. The more stamina you have, the faster
            you'll recover. So if you want your wounds to heal quickly, you
            should eat something and replenish your stamina first."

Para-Medic: "Snake!"
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "Are you smoking a cigarette?"
Snake: "Nope..."
Para-Medic: "Yes, you are."
Snake: "It's not a cigarette, it's a cigar."
Para-Medic: "Same thing."
Snake: "Not at all. In fact, there's a world of difference. There's nothing
       quite like the rich smell and mellow flavor of a cigar. And that thick,
       luxurious smoke is almost sensual when it..."
Para-Medic: "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. You know something?"
Snake: "Probably not, but I don't want to hear it."
Para-Medic: "Well, you don't have a choice."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Cigarettes are bad for you."
Snake: "It's not a cigarette, it's a..."
Para-Medic: "Quiet, you!"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Smoking is bad for you. In a recent study, scients found that
            tobacco smoke is full of carcinogenic substances, like 
            nitrosamines. You know what that means? It means you're going to
            give yourself lung cancer if you keep on smoking. But that's just
            what some scientists think, right?"
Snake: "Oh, give me a break. I heard it was just a bunch of hu-hah."
Para-Medic: "Do you really believe that?"
Snake: "Sure."
Para-Medic: "God, you're gullible. You ought to read this year's report from
            the Surgeon General. It proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that
            smoking causes lung cancer. Pretty soon this whole world will know
            that smoking is bad for you. Better quit now before it's too late."
Snake: "But..."
Para-Medic: "And don't tell me that cigar smoke is harmless because it doesn't
            go down into your lungs. It must means the cancer shows up in a
            different place."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Got it?"
Snake: "Yeah, yeah..."

The Boss: "Camouflage is an indispensable tool when you're sneaking through the
          jungle. To use camouflage, first press the START button to go to the
          Survival Viewer. Then select CAMOUFLAGE and press the Enter Button.
          Select UNIFORM to select battle fatigues, and FACE to select face
          paint. Choose battle fatigues that match the surrounding environment.
          The most effective camouflage is attained by selecting fatigues that
          blend it with the environment. Camouflage patterns that stand out in
          your surroundings will attract attention."

---

The Boss: "Visibility is poor in the jungle, so you'll be finding yourself in a
          lot of unexpected encounters. Naturally, this means that close-
          -quarters combat will be more important than ever."
Snake: "So I'll have plenty of chances to use CQC, then."
The Boss: "That's right. In proximity encounters, firing a gun isn't
          necessarily the best response to every situation. It's only one
          option among many. Rather than taking the time to draw, aim, and fire
          a gun, engaging your opponent in hand-to-hand combat can sometimes be
          a faster and more reliable way of subduing him. Besides, in a 
          sneaking mission like this one it's too dangerous to go around firing
          your gun. You'll end up revealing yourself to the enemy."
Snake: "Yeah, I know. You created CQC to deal with exactly this type of
       situation."
The Boss: "With your help of course. In a battle situation, you'll only have a
          split second to decide how to attack. Use the Weapon Button to attack
          using a weapon, and the CQC Button to attack using CQC. Press the CQC
          Button once to throw a punch. Pressing it multiple times in 
          succession will allow you to deliver a combo attack. But striking
          your opponent is just one aspect of CQC. It doesn't really start to
          shine until you've got your enemy in a hold. Press and hold down the
          CQC Button to grab your opponent with your right hand. From there, 
          you can use the left analog stick to knock your opponent off balance
          and throw him to the ground. This can be used to knock an opponent 
          out in a single blow. If you don't press the left analog stick, 
          grapple with your enemy until you're behind them and can get your
          knife to their throat. Grabbing an enemy from behind and holding your
          knife against his throat will render him virtually powerless. From
          this point, there are several things you can do. Press the CQC Button
          hard to slit the enemy's throat with your knife. Move the left analog
          stick and press the CQC Button to throw the enemy to the ground. 
          Lightly tap the CQC Button rapidly to choke the enemy. You can even
          use this to knock him out, or even kill him if you do it long enough.
          By continuing to hold down the CQC Button, you can move around while
          keeping your grip on the enemy. By pressing the Weapon Button, you
          can aim your currently equipped weapon at another enemy. With their
          comrade acting as a human shield, the enemy will be reluctant to 
          attack you. Press the L3 button to press your knife against the
          enemy and demand information. You'll be surprised at how much you
          can learn this way. But don't get too complacent. While your enemy
          may be powerless in your grip, he'll use any opportunity he can to
          counterattack."

---

The Boss: "You can only use CQC to grab enemies when your right hand is free to
          grab and pull them toward you - in other words, when you're bare
          handed or equipped with a one-handed weapon like the survival knife
          or a handgun. You won't be able to grab hold of enemies when equipped
          with two-handed weapons such as the assault rifle or weapons such as
          hand grenades that don't leave your right hand free to control the
          enemy."
Snake: "So in other words, I can't throw enemies with CQC when I'm holding an
       assault rifle or a hand grenade."
The Boss: "Exactly. Don't forget it."

The Boss: "The gun you're using is a test model of a suppressor-equipped
          pistol currently in development by the Navy, that's been modified
          by the CIA into a tranquilizer gun. The suppressor-equipped pistol
          it's derived from is itself being developed for use by Special
          Forces based on the M39..."
Snake: "The Mk22."
The Boss: "That's what they're going to call it if they decide to adopt it for
          official use... It uses a slide-lock mechanism, that will keep the 
          firing sound down to a minimum..."
Snake: "But I'll have to reload it by hand every time I fire. Right?"
The Boss: "Right. You won't be able to fire multiple shots at once, so make
          every shot count. Aim for the enemy's vital spots. There's talk of
          designing the Mk22 to accommodate special subsonic rounds, but for
          this mission you'll be using specifically designed tranquilizer
          rounds. In a way, these tranquilizer rounds are like miniature
          syringes. When one of them strikes a target, the impact causes a
          needle contained within to shoot out. At the same time, chemicals
          inside the round are mixed to create a gas, which pushes the 
          plunger and injects the tranquilizer into the target. You can knock
          out an enemy immediately by shooting them in the head. But if you
          shoot them in the arm or leg, the tranquilizing agent will take
          some time to set in. Aim carefully."

---

The Boss: "Normally, you would ask a fellow soldier how well your camouflage
          is working. But this is a solo sneaking mission, so nobody out
          there is on your side. You have to determine how well your 
          camouflage is working by yourself."
Snake: "Yeah, I know."
The Boss: "Don't worry. That's what the Camo Index is for. The Camo Index
          tells you how well you've imitated the surroundings. The higher
          the index, the more well-disguised you are. With a high enough
          Camo Index, you can even fool enemies inches away. If you are in
          an area where encounters are a high concern, keep your Camo Index
          high. Got it?"

---

The Boss: "This is a solo sneaking mission. There's no one out there to
          support you. You'll need to be more than just a soldier. You'll
          have to be a medic, a pilot, and even a cook."
Snake: "You don't need to remind me."
The Boss: "I'm glad to hear that."
Snake: "Glad to hear what?"
The Boss: "That you haven't changed a bit."
Snake: "?"
The Boss: "The truth is, you're nervous, aren't you?"
Snake: "I'm not nervous."
The Boss: "There's no need to be embarrassed. No one's ever attemped a mission
          like this before. In fact, you might say that getting nervous is the
          natural way to react."
Snake: "..."
The Boss: "Relax. That's why you have the Survival Viewer. The Survival Viewer
          contains everything you'll need to stay alive in the field. Use
          'CAMOUFLAGE' to change your camouflage, 'BACKPACK' to select a
          weapon, 'FOOD' to eat, and 'CURE' to heal yourself. The 'MAP' option
          lets you view the map. And the 'OPTIONS' function lets you change 
          the settings to suit your individual style. The Survival Viewer is
          going to be your best friend in this mission, so learn to make the
          most of it."

The Boss: "In my day, I did my share of sneakin into enemy territory."
Snake: "You mean since World War II?"
The Boss: "Yeah. Mostly snatch missions."
Snake: "Snatch mission...that's where you abduct an enemy officer without
       killing him, right?"
The Boss: "Right. That's where I got the original idea for CQC. In a snatch
          mission, taking out the target's escorts by shooting them is not an
          option. If the enemy hears the gunshot, they'll know there's an
          intruder and tighten security. And the target will sense danger and
          try to get away."
Snake: "You needed a way to take out the guards and secure the guards without
       making a sound..."
The Boss: "That was the idea. The CQC style that you and I developed is based
          on the techniques I cultivated during those missions. So..."
Snake: "First time I've heard this."
The Boss: "Huh?"
Snake: "You never told me any of this before."
The Boss: "I didn't?"
Snake: "No. Why?"
The Boss: "?"
Snake: "Why didn't you tell me any of this before? Why now?"
The Boss: "I have my reasons..."

---

The Boss: "I see you're wearing the olive drab uniform. Olive drab, or OD for
          short, is what you might call the 'pre-camouflage' uniform. Plain-
          -colored OD fatigues are still worn by infrantry today, but they'll
          be replaced sooner or later by patterned camouflage. As you can see,
          it's got no colors or markings on it, so of course it won't make a
          very effective disguise. You should change into some other type of
          camouflage as soon as you can."

---

The Boss: "I see you're wearing the tiger stripe camouflage. The tiger stripe
          pattern has been in use since 1959 among the South Vietnamese Marine
          Corps. But the pattern originated with the French. It's said that it
          developed out of the brush stroke pattern, also known as 'lizard
          camouflage'. It provides some cover in trees and grass, but it's
          especially effective in earth and mud environments. You should find
          it useful when you're concealing yourself by crawling on the ground."

---

The Boss: "I see you're wearing the leaf pattern camouflage. The leaf pattern
          was developed to provide cover in forest environments. The U.S.
          military isn't the only one using it. Countries that anticipate
          operating in forest environments are developing various types of
          patterns, each suited to the vegetation of the particular region.
          The Soviets and the Eastern European countries all use their own
          unique patterns. Leaf pattern camo will give you an especially low
          profile in areas of thick vegetation."

---

The Boss: "I see you're wearing the tree bark camouflage. The tree bark pattern
          was originally created for use by hunters. Unlike the somewhat
          abstract designs seen in other patterns. Tree bark is characterized
          by a design that resembles photographs of stumps and branches pasted
          together. It's especially good when you're pressed up against a
          tree."

---

The Boss: "I see you're wearing the squares pattern camouflage. The squares
          camouflage consists of a series of squares, each varying slightly in
          color and shape from the next. It has the effect of making the
          contours of the person wearing it more difficult to distinguish.
          You'll find it especially useful against brick and rusted metal
          backgrounds."

---

The Boss: "I see you're wearing the black camouflage. People tend to associate
          black camo with night operations, but that's not always the case.
          Wearing all black when you're out in the forest at night makes your
          silhouette darker and more prominent, and you end up standing out
          instead. To get the most out of your camouflage, it's essential to
          choose a pattern that matches your surroundings - even at night.
          Don't forget that."

---

The Boss: "Choose battle fatigues that match the surrounding environment.
          The most effective camouflage is attained by selecting fatigues that
          blend it with the environment. Camouflage patterns that stand out in
          your surroundings will attract attention."

---

The Boss: "It takes more than just clothes to make a good disguise. To
          camouflage yourself effectively, you'll need to wear face paint.
          Face paint is camouflage applied to the face. Bare skin sticks out
          like a sore thumb in the jungle, so always protect yourself with face
          paint. Choose a color that matches the features of your surroundings,
          and use your finger to apply the face paint. Start by applying a
          light color, then gradually moving up in darkness. That way, even if
          you make a mistake, you can cover it up with a later, darker color.
          In order to flatten the appearance of your face, use light colors on
          areas of your face that recede, and dark colors on areas that
          protrude. Open the Survival Viewer, go to CAMOUFLAGE, then select
          FACE, and you'll find the selection of face paints. Be sure to select
          a face paint that makes you blend right into your surroundings.
          Okay?"

The Boss: "You're wearing the woodland face paint, I see. The woodland face
          paint is designed for use in forests. It'll give you a high level of
          camouflage in a wooded environment. Try using woodland paint when
          you're traveling through the forest."

---

The Boss: "You're wearing black face paint, huh? Painting your face black will
          raise your Camo Index in dark areas. If you find yourself in any dark
          areas, make sure to use the black face paint."

---

The Boss: "Camouflage is about blending in with nature. To ensure effective
          camouflage, you have to stay low and keep still. As long as you have
          camouflage fatigues, face paint that matches the environment, and lay
          on your stomach, you don't need to be concerned with being spotted by
          distant enemies. On the other hand, no amount of camouflage will keep
          you hidden from the enemy if you're running around. So, when you need
          to hide from the enemy, lie as low as possible, and stay still. You
          can check the Camo Index to see how your movement and position 
          affects the quality of your disguise."

The Boss: "To place a weapon on your person, go to the Survival Viewer, then
          BACKPACK, then select WEAPON. A list of weapons will be shown in a
          window in the upper left. Select the weapon you wish to put on your
          person with the left analog stick and press the Enter Button to 
          remove the weapon from your backpack and equip it to your person.
          However, you can only carry so many weapons at once on your person.
          Put unnecessary weapons back into your backpack. Select a weapon on
          your person from the weapon list and press the Enter Button to put
          that weapon into your backpack. Your situation determines what
          weapons are most useful. Consider this when choosing which weapons to
          put on your person. Okay, Snake?"

The Boss: "Press the First Person View Button to switch to the First Person 
          View. In First Person View, you can look at the surroundings through
          your own eyes. The Overhead View's range is limited. If you plow 
          ahead using only the Overhead View, you put yourself in danger of
          running into an enemy without even realizing he was there. Make
          regular stops, and check your surroundings with First Person View.
          Okay, Snake?"

The Boss: "Hunters have known about camouflage since ancient times. But it's
          only quite recently - since the 18th century - that it's been applied
          to military operations. The first camouflage introduced to the
          military was a solid-colored uniform designed to blend in with the
          battlefield. It was really more of a protective coloring than true
          camouflage. Camouflage, in the modern sense of the word, wasn't
          introduced until the First World War. During that war, weapons such
          as aircraft, cannon [sic] and warships were painted in camouflage
          colors. But it was almost never used to disguise individual
          soldiers... The widespread use of camouflage began in World War II.
          The Germans and the Russians, in particular, made active use of it
          in battle. Nowadays, with the Cold War raging, the Eastern bloc has
          been hard at work developing all sorts of camouflage patterns. In the
          West, the French implemented it in their paratrooper corps and SAS
          during the wars of independence in Indochina. I never saw it used in
          Korea, though. America has lagged behind other countries in 
          incorporating camouflage. They're just beginning to consider 
          introducing it into certain units."
Snake: "Why is that?"
The Boss: "Apparently, there are those in the U.S. military who consider
          camouflage too 'passive' a technique."
Snake: "Morons."
The Boss: "You're telling me. But now more and more people are beginning to
          appreciate how useful and important camouflage can be. I'm sure the
          brass will see the light soon enough."

---

The Boss: "The sooner you find the enemy, the better you'll be able to deal
          with the situation. So be sure to make use of sensors like the motion
          detector and active sonar."

---

The Boss: "When you aim your handgun in First Person View, align the front
          sight and the rear sight of the gun with the target, then fire."

---

The Boss: For the assault rifle and certain other weapons, pressing the Weapon 
          Button will first ready the gun for shooting from the hip. If you're
          in a close-quarters fight or other situation that requires immediate
          action, fire from that position. Observe where your shots are 
          hitting, and correct your aim accordingly."
Snake: "I understand, but that doesn't sound too accurate."
The Boss: "Of course not. So when you require pinpoint targeting, like when
          firing from afar or sniping, hold the Aim Button to aim. Carefully
          align your front and rear sights to concentrate fire and gain a
          sharper view on your target."

---

The Boss: "In the jungle, it's absolutely crucial to keep your position secret
          from the enemy. Sometimes even the smallest sound can be enough to
          give your position away and get you killed. You'll have to make sure
          your weapons and equipment don't make noise bumping around. Use tape
          to secure metal objects and other items that seem likely to produce
          noise. After you've secured your gear, jump up and down to see
          whether it makes a sound."
Snake: "Don't worry. I remember the drill."

---

The Boss: "Select 'MAP' in the Survival Viewer to view a map of the area you're
          currently in. It shows your present location and the places you've
          been to. In addition, if you acquire information from enemies, the
          map may also display enemy unit positions and the locations of items.
          To get information from an enemy, grab him from behind using CQC and
          press the L3 button. To succeed in any mission, knowing how to put
          information about the zone of operation to effective use will be
          essential. 'MAP' will serve you well."

---

The Boss: "Keep in mind that your weapons and equipment each have their own
          weight. Storing a heavy item on your person will cause your stamina
          to drain more quickly. If you're getting tired or want to conserve
          your stamina, it's a good idea to put any items you're not going to
          use back into your backpack."

---

The Boss: "There is one weapon greater than any other in battle - do you know
          what that is?"
Snake: "Yeah."
The Boss: "What?"
Snake: "Do we have to go through this again?"
The Boss: "Yes."
Snake: "...Will. An unflinching will to survive no matter what."
The Boss: "Exactly. The will to carry out your mission and return home alive
          will see you through even the most desperate of situations. It's the
          most potent weapon in your arsenal. Don't forget that. No matter 
          what."

---

The Boss: "Treetops, bushes, hollow logs...there are plenty of places in nature
          you can use to hide yourself. Search each area carefully in First
          Person View. Use nature to its fullest extent. You'll thank me
          later."

---

The Boss: "If you want to survive in the jungle, you're going to need to hone
          all of your senses. An unnatural movement in the undergrowth, a tiny
          shadow peeking out through the trees in the distance - always keep an
          eye out for any signs of the enemy's presence. Your sense of hearing
          is equally important. Visibility is poor in the jungle, so you've got
          to learn to pick up the enemy's presence from the sounds you hear 
          around you. Always be listening for that one snap of a twig among the
          chirping of the birds and the babbling of the brooks. Your sense of
          smell is also important. Body odor, sweat, gunpowder, food...these
          faint smells wafting in the wind will tell you where the enemy..."
Snake: "Uh, no."
The Boss: "No?"
Snake: "I can't smell."
The Boss: "You...what now?"
Snake: "I can't smell."
The Boss: "Not at all?"
Snake: "Nope."
The Boss: "Not even a little bit?"
Snake: "Not a thing."
The Boss: "Oh...well, then, you'll just have to trust your instincts as a
          gamer."

---

The Boss: "If your rapid-fire the assault rifle, the recoil of the gun will
          cause your shots to stray from their intended targets. Firing from a
          crouched position or while lying on your stomach will stabilize the
          recoil, and keep your hits more consistent."

---

The Boss: "Equipment captured in the field often needs to be fixed or have its
          parts replaced before it can be used. But you won't need to worry 
          about that in this mission."
Snake: "Why's that?"
The Boss: "Because your adversaries are highly trained professionals. They'll
          no doubt have made sure their reserve gear is in working condition."
Snake: "So in other words, I can use the stuff I pick up right away?"
The Boss: "Right. One more thing - when you pick up a new item, don't forget
          to read its description in the window."

---

The Boss: "When you see an enemy, the first thing you should do is conceal
          yourself and watch what he's doing. If you make any sudden moves,
          your Camo Index will decrease and there's a good chance the enemy
          will catch sight of you. And don't start to panic just because an
          enemy is acting like he knows you're there. It doesn't necessarily
          mean he's figured out exactly where you are. As long as you hide
          someplace like the bushes and stay perfectly still, you'll usually
          come out all right. Stay calm, keep a grip on the situation, and use
          clear judgment. Got it?"

---

The Boss: "Your ultimate objective is this mission is to find Sokolov and get
          him to safety, not to slaughter the enemy."
Snake: "So basically I should avoid getting into battles, right? You don't have
       to tell me."
The Boss: "To avoid battles, it will be essential to scout out the enemy's
          numbers and positions. That's what your binoculars are for."

---

The Boss: "Tell me, what's the advantage of a solo sneaking mission?"
Snake: "It's easier to go undetected than with a group."
The Boss: "Exactly. And therein lies the entire reasoning behind this Virtuous
          Mission. This mission into Soviet territory is a violation of
          international law. If this gets out into the public, we'll be faced
          with an international crisis even greater than the one four years 
          ago."
Snake: "Four years ago...the U2 crash."
The Boss: "Failure is not an option."
Snake: "Not a problem. I'll get Sokolov out without them ever knowing I was
       here."

---

The Boss: "Your objective in this mission isn't to get into fights. But if 
          you're faced with a situation where you have no choice but to get rid
          of an enemy, attack them from behind. If you use stalking to sneak up
          behind an enemy and take him out in one strike, the other enemies
          probably won't even notice. If it doesn't look like you'll be able to
          sneak up from behind, wait for him to come toward you. Either figure
          out the enemy's patrol route and get there before he does, or make a
          sound or throw something to get his attention. And if he does spot
          you, don't hesitate. Take him out before he has a chance to alert his
          comrades to your presence. Got it?"

---

The Boss: "Enemies pose a greater threat when they patrol in squads. The
          members of a squad are constantly watching out for each other, making
          it difficult to take them out without being noticed. If you
          absolutely have to attack a squad, use CQC or a gun equipped with a
          suppressor and start with the last one in line, then work your way
          up."

---

The Boss: "I see you're using the EZ Gun. The EZ Gun is a silenced tranquilizer
          gun for special-ops use developed for FOX by the CIA's technology
          division."
Snake: "A silenced tranquilizer gun? I don't see a suppressor on here..."
The Boss: "Apparently, the tranquilizer rounds themselves are designed to
          suppress the sound."
Snake: "Interesting. In other words, I won't have to worry about the suppressor
       wearing out on me, right?"
The Boss: "That's right. It's also equipped with a laser sight so that you can
          make accurate shots even at a distance. In addition, merely equipping
          the EZ GUN should have a positive effect on your Camo Index. I've
          even heard it helps you recover your stamina. Put it to good use."

---

The Boss: "I see you've got the survival knife equipped. The survival knife is
          a necessity in the field. Press the Weapon Button to swing the knife.
          Press it repeatedly to perform a combo attack. The knife should let
          you kill an enemy silently, so you should find it useful when the
          situation calls for stealth. In addition to fighting the enemy, you
          can also use the knife to capture wild animals. That one knife can
          provide you with everything you need to survive in the field. Use it
          well."

---

The Boss: "Ah, you've got a directional microphone. The directional microphone
          is a high-performance listening device. When you equip it, you'll go
          into First Person View, where the microphone will pick up sounds in
          whichever direction it's facing. By pointing the microphone into the
          forest, you can sometimes hear the footsteps of enemy soldiers
          lurking beyond the trees. In jungle combat, success depends on how
          well you can sense the enemy's presence. Use it well."

---

The Boss: "Snake, did you take off your uniform?"
Snake: "Yeah."
The Boss: "What's the matter?"
Snake: "Just needed to loosen up."
The Boss: "...I know there's a 'NAKED' option under 'UNIFORM' in the
          'CAMOUFLAGE' window that lets you take off your uniform. But without
          a uniform on, your Camo Index will remain low, and you'll quickly
          burn through your stamina more quickly. So stop acting like a fool 
          and put some camouflage on, now!"
Snake: "..."
The Boss: "Did you hear me!?"
Snake: "Yeah..."

---

The Boss: "I see you're not wearing any face paint. Selecting 'NO PAINT' for
          'FACE' under 'CAMOUFLAGE' lets you remove your face paint. But
          without face paint your camouflage alone won't be sufficient. So if
          you need a high Camo Index, make sure you're wearing face paint. Got
          it?"

The Boss: "Are you smoking a cigar?"
Snake: "Uh huh."
The Boss: "I don't approve of you smoking during a mission."
Snake: "Hey, you used to smoke them."
The Boss: "Never mind what I did."
Snake: "..."
The Boss: "But that being said, cigars can be useful in a number of ways. Like
          getting rid of leeches."
Snake: "Did you say leeches?"
The Boss: "Yes. If a leech clamps onto you, try pressing the lit end of a cigar
          onto it. The leech should cringe and detach itself from you. If you
          try to yank it off by yourself, you run the risk of it leaving its
          teeth inside you. With the cigar method, you won't have that
          problem."
Snake: "Fascinating."
The Boss: "And unlike the cigarette, a cigar burns slowly, so you can use it in
          place of a torch in dark places."
Snake: "I never knew a cigar had so many different uses..."
The Boss: "Now you know. But quit smoking them during the mission."
Snake: "..."
The Boss: "Hear me?"
Snake: "Yes, ma'am..."

---

The Boss: "I see you're using binoculars. The ones you've got are a high
          performance military model equipped with a zoom function."
Snake: "Yeah. They give a flat image across the entire viewing range."
The Boss: "They're completely waterproof and highly shock- and flame-
          resistant. You won't need to worry about them breaking. Scouting is
          the key during a sneaking mission. If you can determine enemy
          positions and the lay of the land from a distance, it'll make your
          job that much easier. Use them wisely."

Major Tom: "Snake, be careful of that swamp."
Snake: "What's dangerous about it?
Major Tom: "It's a bottomless swamp."
Snake: "A bottomless swamp?"
Major Tom: "Yes. The mud in that swamp is highly viscous [sic]. It will stick
           to your body like tar. It will be impossible for you to swim. If you
           get swallowed by the bottomless swamp, you won't be able to escape
           on your own. Once you sink down to about head-level, you'll be 
           trapped for good. Make sure you get out before that happens."
Snake: "So, I have to make sure I don't sink too far. Got it."
Major Tom: "Snake, wait."
Snake: "There's more?"
Major Tom: "Yes."
Snake: "What?"
Major Tom: "Crocodiles."
Snake: "Crocodiles?"
Major Tom: "Yes."
Snake: "Crocodiles? Like the reptile..."
Major Tom: "That's correct. More accurately, they're Indian Gavials."
Snake: "What are crocs doing deep in this forest?"
Major Tom: "You'll have to ask Para-Medic about that one. Para-Medic?"
Para-Medic: "Yes. The Indian Gavial is a crocodile that originally lived in
            freshwater regions in India and Nepal."
Snake: "Why are Indian crocodiles way out here?"
Para-Medic: "They're captive crocodiles that were brought here for research
            purposes, but escaped and became wild again. Indian Gavials are
            large creatures - adult males grow to over six meters in length.
            You'll never catch one alive. Even if you use the tranquilizer
            gun."
Snake: "Got it. So, how do they..."
Para-Medic: "Taste? Yes, I did look into that. You know what they always say -
            tastes like chicken!"
Snake: "Sounds delicious."
Para-Medic: "But be careful when capturing an Indian Gavial. Normally, they're
            cowardly creatures, but the ones in the forest there are
            belligerent. Apparently they attack humans."
Snake: "What do you mean?"
Para-Medic: "They weren't the direct subject of any serious research, but some
            think they may have become violent as a side-effect of the atomic
            research that was conducted nearby."

---

Para-Medic: "That area is inhabited by Indian Gavials. The Indian Gavial is a
            large crocodile native to India and Nepal. It's extremely
            aggressive, so watch out. It's got a tough hide, so you'll have a
            hard time catching one. Capturing them alive is probably out of the
            question."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, you will encounter Baltic Hornets' nests in that area.
            Baltic Hornets are a variety of hornets that inhabit that area. The
            difference between them and other hornets is that they produce
            honey in their nests. Inside the nest are larva, pupa, and adults -
            you can eat them all. In particular, the honey you find inside the
            nest is delicious and full of nutrients. It's easy to digest and
            helps peop you up when you're feeling tired. In short, it's the
            perfect survival food. Honey can also be used as a burn ointment.
            When honey is applied to a burn, it creates a protective coating
            over the skin. When you knock down a hornets' nest, a burn ointment
            will appear along with it, so don't forget to pick it up. Of
            course, the hornets aren't going to give up their nest without a
            fight. If you knock a nest down, a large swarm of hornets will come
            flying out, so be careful."

Major Tom: "Snake, do you see any tufts of grass?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Tom: "What kind of grass?"
Snake: "Just ordinary grass. Nothing special..."
Major Tom: "You should check it anyhow."
Snake: "...It's pretty thick grass. About waist-high."
Major Tom: "If you crawl into the grass, you can advance undercover. When you
           do, the camera automatically switches to Intrusion View. If you
           want to stand up again, press and hold the Crawl Button once more.
           If you press the Crawl Button briefly, you'll crouch in that spot.
           This allows you to observe things without blowing your cover. Got
           it?"
Snake: "Yeah, but..."
Major Tom: "But what?"
Snake: "Was that the only reason?"
Major Tom: "What do you mean?"
Snake: "You had me check it just to tell me that?"
Major Tom: "That's right."
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "Pretty useful huh?"
Snake: "...Right."
Major Tom: "Shall we carry on?"
Snake: "By all means."
Major Tom: "Even when hidden in grass, if you make a noise, your enemies will
           locate you. When enemies are nearby, move with slight movements of
           the left analog stick. That way you can proceed with minimal 
           disturbance."

Major Tom: "Thermal goggles create a thermal image based on the heat emitted
           by objects in view. With the thermal goggles equipped, you will
           be able to quickly spot enemies hidden deep within the jungle. 
           Also, you can locate plants, animals, and traps. Use it to your
           advantage. However, once you activate the thermal goggles, you
           begin draining battery energy. And remember - once you're out of
           battery juice, you won't be able to use your other electronic
           devices."

Para-Medic: "That area is home to the Sunda Whistling-Thrush. The Sunda 
            Whistling-Thrush is a bird native to Java and Sumatra. It's
            distinguished by its large blue body and long beak. It really 
            stands out in the forest. If you're aiming to catch one alive,
            use the tranquilizer gun."
Snake: "Got it. So?"
Para-Medic: "How does it taste?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "I dunno."
Snake: "You don't know?"
Para-Medic: "The guide doesn't say. I guess there's no reason you couldn't eat
            them."
Snake: "Oh, I see..."
Para-Medic: "But it's nice and plump, so I'm sure it'd make a hearty meal."
Snake: "That's a good point!"
Para-Medic: "..."

Para-Medic: "You'll find a fruit called the Yabloko Moloko growing in that
            area."
Snake: "Yablo...what now?"
Para-Medic: "Yabloko Moloko. It's a Russian name that roughtly translates as
            'milk apple.' It's a type of star apple. The juice is thick and
            sweet, like milk - hence the name. And if you cut one in half
            lengthwise, you'll see a star-shaped ring radiating out from the
            center."
Snake: "Hence the star apple?"
Para-Medic: "Right. The star-shaped part has a gelatinous texture and is said
            to be especially tasty."
Snake: "Sounds useful."
Para-Medic: "You're welcome."
Snake: "For once..."
Para-Medic: "Did you say something?"
Snake: "No. Back to the mission."

Para-Medic: "Snake, there's a fruit called the Golova growing in that area."
Snake: "Golova?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. It's a fruit that's found only in that region. It's related
            to the jackfruit, which is commonly found in Southeast Asia."
Snake: "Jack...fruit, huh..."
Para-Medic: "Yep, he's a cannibal."
Snake: "Huh?"
Para-Medic: "I didn't say anything."
Snake: "No, I'm sure you..."
Para-Medic: "I said I'm sure you'd like it."
Snake: "Oh."
Para-Medic: "Golova means 'head' in Russia. It's probably called that because
            the fruit grows to about the size of a human head. It's supposedly
            pretty good to eat, with a uniquely sweet flavor. The fruit is
            fairly large, so you could make a meal out of it. Golovas grow
            directly off the trunk of the tree. If you're running low on
            stamina, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on the tree
            trunks."

Para-Medic: "Snake, if you or one of your comrades is wounded in battle, what
            do you usually do?"
Snake: "I call for a medic."
Para-Medic: "What if there's no medic nearby?"
Snake: "I don't even want to think about that."
Para-Medic: "Think about it."
Snake: "...That's my worst nightmare."
Para-Medic: "Any soldier can perform basic first aid, but it takes a specialist
            to perform the more complicated procedures."
Snake: "I know a lot of guys who'd still be alive if they'd had access to a
       medic."
Para-Medic: "Me, too. So I got to thinking - wouldn't it be great if we could
            parachute medics into the front lines, where they're needed most?"
Snake: "You bet... That's why you're called 'Para-Medic'?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. With a unit like that, we could save a couple of lives, huh?
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "No?"
Snake: "Not a couple. We could save many lives."
Para-Medic: "...Thanks. I think the army needs a unit like that. And if no one
            else will do it, I'm going to create one myself."
Snake: "Sounds like a plan."
Para-Medic: "Will you help me?"
Snake: "Count on it."

Para-Medic: "Snake, do you know what epinephrine is?"
Snake: "What's with the questions?"
Para-Medic: "Well, do you?"
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "Also known as adrenaline?"
Snake: "Never heard of it."
Para-Medic: "Really."
Snake: "Nope."
Para-Medic: "I have."
Snake: "Good for you."
Para-Medic: "Do you want to hear about it?"
Snake: "Not really."
Para-Medic:
Snake: "Here we go."
Para-Medic: "So... Epinephrine is a type of hormone. It's secreted from the
            adrenal glands in high-stress situations - like when you're 
            exercising, or you're under pressure. The epinephrine is released
            into the blood-stream and stimulates special receptor cells on
            various organs throughout the body. This causes the heart to beat
            faster, the blood vessels to constrict, and the respiratory
            passages to expand. It also raises blood pressure. You ever notice
            how you're faster and stronger than normal when you're under 
            stress? That's because of epinephrine. And when you're bleeding,
            it..."
Snake: "Para-Medic..."
Para-Medic: "Yeah?"
Snake: "Is there a point to all this?"
Para-Medic: "Of course. In the Alert Phase, your body secretes epinephrine, and
            so your stamina won't be depleted as fast."
Snake: "...Uh huh."
Para-Medic: "There, good thing I told you, huh?"
Snake: "As always."

Para-Medic: "You can capture animals alive by using the tranquilizer gun or a
            mousetrap. When you capture a live animal, you can carry it with 
            you as a weapon by going to 'BACKPACK' in the Survival Viewer. Once
            an animal is on your person, equip it and press the Weapon button 
            to throw it. Throwing a venomous animal at an enemy might be enough
            to knock him out. Even non-venomous animals like frogs can be used
            to distract the enemy's attention. And since I know you're going to
            ask me, yes, keeping animals alive prevents them from rotting and
            makes them taste better when you eat them. Remember, though, you've
            only got three cages for capturing live animals."

Snake: "Para-Medic."
Para-Medic: "Hmm?"
Snake: "You said you like movies, right?"
Para-Medic: "I love 'em."
Snake: "About the major's code name..."
Para-Medic: "Major Tom?"
Snake: "Yeah. He sounded like he wasn't sure whether or not 'Tom' was the name
       of the tunnel that worked in 'The Great Escape'."
Para-Medic: "So I heard."
Snake: "So was it?"
Para-Medic: "Was it what?"
Snake: "Was 'Tom' really the name of the tunnel that worked?"
Para-Medic: "Right."
Snake: "So it was 'Tom'?"
Para-Medic: "Maybe."
Snake: "Maybe?"
Para-Medic: "I dunno."
Snake: "Why don't you know?"
Para-Medic: "Why should I know?"
Snake: "You watch a lot of movies, don't you?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah."
Snake: "But you've never seen 'The Great Escape'?"
Para-Medic: "No."
Snake: "Why not?"
Para-Medic: "It didn't look interesting."
Snake: "You don't watch movies that don't look interesting?"
Para-Medic: "That's right."
Snake: "And yet you've seen 'The Fly'?"
Para-Medic: "'The Fly' looked interesting. And it was."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Something wrong?"
Snake: "Nothing. Tell me, what other kind of movies do you like?"
Para-Medic: "Voyons voir. Il y a 'Le monstre', 'It Conquered the World' et
            'Earth versus The Spider'. Et j'oubliais 'Mondo Cane'..."

The Boss: "I see you got your hands on an SVD. The SVD is the Soviet Union's
          most advanced automatic fire sniper rifle. It's said to be better
          designed and more durable than anything the West has."
Snake: "It looks kind of like an AK-47."
The Boss: "The shape is similar, but the interval mechanism is one of a kind.
          It uses 7.62 x 54 mm rimmed cartridges, which are more powerful and
          precise than the ones the AK uses. It can be a powerful weapon if you
          know how to use it. Sniper rifles aren't meant to be used on the
          move. When you equip one, you'll immediately go into First Person
          View. The more stable your stance, the less your hands will shake
          while your'e aiming the rifle. Make sure you're lying down before
          attempting to make a long-distance shot. To use the scope, press the
          Aim Button. You can also use the Action Button to change the level of
          magnification. By taking out enemies from a distance with the sniper
          rifle, you can shift the odds in your favor. Use it well."

---

The Boss: "That's certainly a strange-looking grenade you've got there."
Snake: "Yeah. I've never seen one like this. What is it...?"
The Boss: "It must be a new type of grenade developed by the Russians. From
          what I can tell, it's a non-lethal weapon that uses a flash of light
          and intense sound to overpower the senses of human targets. You can
          probably use that grenade to knock out the enemy without killing
          them. It might prove useful."

---

The Boss: "You said the enemy is equipped with AK-47s, didn't you? The AK-47
          is the official assault rifle of the Soviet army. It's employed not
          only by the Soviets, but throughout the Eastern bloc. It uses 7.62mm
          x 39 ammunitions, with a magazine capacity of 30 rounds. The AK is
          reliable, precise, powerful, and easy to handle - in short, one of 
          the best assault rifles there is. Don't even think about getting into
          a one-man firefight against an enemy unit equipped with AKs. Avoid
          battle as much as possible. Are we clear?"

---

The Boss: "You mentioned the enemy was also carrying grenades, correct? Those
          grenades are RGD-5s, the standard blast-fragmentation grenade of the
          Soviet army. You can protect yourself from a large part of the blast
          and shrapnel from a grenade by lying flat on the ground. If someone
          throws a grenade at you and you sense that you can't get away in 
          time, get into a crawl position. It should reduce the damage to a
          minimum."

The Boss: "Those things you're wearing...those are... Thermal goggles. Some
          kind of electronic gadget that shows the distribution of heat sources
          in image form. I know they're based on the same principle behind the
          FLIR system on gunships. But to think they actually made it small
          enough to carry with you... They're not just making good rockets huh?
          Never underestimate the power of Soviet science."
Snake: "Tell me about it."
The Boss: "In any case, those thermal goggles should allow you to easily see
          through enemy camouflage and spot traps. Just don't leave them on too
          long, or you'll drain the batteries."

The Boss: "You have some LIFE medicine with you. LIFE medicine is a recent
          pharmaceutical product developed by the Soviet Union. It works with
          your metabolism to quickly treat wounds. If you use it, you can 
          recover LIFE on the spot. Try it when your LIFE is starting to run
          low in battle."

The Boss: "I see you've got a smoke grenade. The smoke grenade does exactly
          what the name implies. It creates a thick, dispersion-resistant
          cloud of white smoke that blocks the enemy's field of vision. It
          should be useful when you need to make a quick getaway. Keep it in 
          mind."

---

The Boss: "I see you've found yourself an RGD-5. RGD stands for 'Ruchnaya
          Granata Degtyareva' in Russian. It basically means 'hand grenade of
          the Degtyarev design.' It's the standard issue blast-fragmentation
          grenade of the Soviet army. It's lighter than the M26. And it carries
          fewer explosives as well. But I'd say it's more or less equal to an
          M26 in terms of performance. Be careful, though - the safety pin ring
          is on the opposite side. You'll be as fine as long as you keep the
          safety level pressed down with your finger."
Snake: "I'll keep that in mind."
The Boss: "Blast-fragmentation grenades use a combination of blast and shrapnel
          to kill their targets. This makes them effective against standing
          targets, but significantly less effective against targets lying on
          the ground. Remember that."

---

The Boss: "That's an interesting grenade you've got there."
Snake: "Yeah. I've never seen anything like this before..."
The Boss: "Apparently it's designed to disrupt radio waves by scattering tiny
          pieces of metal into the air. The Russians probably developed it as
          a personal anti-electronics weapon. You can use that grenade to block
          radio communications between enemy soldiers. Then they won't be able
          to call for reinforcements, huh?"
The Boss: "That's right. But remember that as long as the radio disruption 
          lasts, your active sonar and motion detector will be rendered
          inoperable."

Major Tom: "Snake, when you knock down a hornets' nest, a large swarm of
           hornets will come flying out. If used wisely, this can sow panic
           among the enemy, but if you're not careful, the hornets may end up
           attacking you."
Para-Medic: "If you're attacked by hornets, wiggle the left analog stick or
            wave your survival knife to shoo them away. Smoke is another useful
            tool in keeping hornets away. If you're attacked by hornets, I'd
            advise you to try using a smoke grenade. And if you use the 
            insecticidal bug juice, the hornets should stay away as long as
            the effect lasts. Hornets are prone to becoming agitated and
            aggressive when they see the color black. Their attacks will be
            more vicious if you're wearing black clothes. If you're attacked
            by hornets, you should change into white clothes."

The Boss: "The weapon you're equipped with now is called the XM16E1. It's a
          new type of rifle currently being developed by the U.S. Army."
Snake: "If it's still in development, then what's it doing here?"
The Boss: "My guess is they captured it when it was being battle-tested in
          Southeast Asia. But the one you've got there is quite a bit different
          from the ones I've been hearing about. For one thing, it's camo-
          -painted and it's fitted with a three-shot burst mechanism. It even
          looks like you could attach a suppressor... All of these 
          modifications are geared toward jungle combat."
Snake: "This doesn't look like the work of the Soviets.
The Boss: "My guess is they were added on-site by an American gunsmith during
          the army field trials. Open the Weapon Window and press the Enter
          Button to attach or remove the suppressor. Press the Action Button
          to switch between semi-auto, full auto, and three-shot burst modes.
          Make use of each of these functions as the situations warrants."

Major Tom: "Snake, Sokolov is imprisoned in the northeast area of the factory."
Snake: "Got it. To the northeast."
Major Tom: "Yes. And don't engage the enemy. The object of this mission is to
           bring Sokolov back safely, and nothing more. Contact Sokolov without
           being spotted by the enemy, and bring him out discreetly. If you 
           must dispose of an enemy, do it with the tranquilizer gun."

---

Major Tom: "Snake, as I said before, this mission is only to bring Sokolov
           back safely. You must not put him in danger. You're not allowed to
           contact him during the Alert Phase. Period."

Snake: "Major, you said the enemy was KGB, right?"
Major Tom: "I did."
Snake: "What unit are they from? The Sixth Directorate?"
Major Tom: "No, the Ninth Directorate."
Snake: "The Ninth?"
Major Tom: "Yes."
Snake: "But I thought it was..."
Major Tom: "Exactly. It's the unit that protects the Kremlin and provides
           bodyguards for high-level VIPs."
Snake: "But they're assigned to protect 'Party and government' figures. I
       thought that meant high-ranking officials and their families. And now
       they're being sent out to watch over a field exercise?"
Major Tom: "That's the idea."
Snake: "What's really going on?"
Major Tom: "I don't know."
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "What I do know is that the director of the Ninth Director is a
           well-known protge of Khrushchev. The premier may have wanted to
           assign this mission to someone he knew he could trust."
Snake: "So he can't trust any other units?"
Major Tom: "Ever since the withdrawal from Cuba, Khrushchev's position has
           been getting weaker day by day. This secret test is an act of
           desperation by a cornered man. If nothing else, the completion of
           Sokolov's new weapon in this test should help reestablish 
           Khrushchev's authority in Moscow."
Snake: "So what you're saying is, there's also a good chance that whoever
       doesn't want to see that happen is going to try and interfere?"
Major Tom: "Most likely. Khrushchev must have anticipated this and sent his
           most loyal unit - his trump card - to make sure all goes well."

Para-Medic: "Snake, there are rats living in that area. The rats in that area

            humans as pets and lab animals. They're not poisonous, and I don't
            think they'll attack you. But they're quick little creatures, so
            you might have a hard time catching one."
Snake: "Uh huh. So, how do they taste?"
Para-Medic: "Snake..."
Snake: "What?"

07) In Rassvet, after Ocelot scene
===============================================================================

Major Tom: "Snake, stay alert. The KGB and GRU both have their sights set on
           Sokolov. GRU is a military espionage outfit, the intelligence wing
           of the Soviet Defense Ministry's General Staff Office. It competes
           with the KGB, which is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and
           the two are always watching each other."
Snake: "Never let the left hand know what the right hand is doing."
Major Tom: "Exactly. Now, added to that rivalry, there's a vicious power 
           struggle going on between the Khrushchev faction and the anti-
           -Khrushchev faction."
Snake: "So Khrushchev is using the KGB, and Volgin and the anti-Khrushchev
       forces are using the GRU?"
Major Tom: "That's the idea. The two factions are fighting over Sokolov.
           We're in an extremely dangerous situation here."
Snake: "Yeah. I'm aware of that."
Major Tom: "Get Sokolov out of there safely. He must not be turned over to
           the KGB or to the GRU. Sokolov took off in the direction of the
           rope bridge. Get after him. Hurry!"

Snake: "Major, have you been able to contact The Boss?"
Major Tom: "No."
Snake: "You really think it's bad reception?"
Major Tom: "We're looking into it."
Snake: "Major..."
Major Tom: "Snake, you've got more important matters to worry about than
           contacting The Boss. Right now, Sokolov is out there wandering 
           around the jungle alone. What are you going to do if he gets caught
           by the enemy?"
Snake: "..."
Major Tom: "We're still looking into why we lost contact with The Boss. I'll
           let you know as soon as we find anything out. In the meantime, it's
           your job to find Sokolov and get him to safety. Got it?"

---

Snake: "Major, do you know anything about this GRU colonel Sokolov was talking
       about?"
Major Tom: "Yes."
Snake: "Who is he?"
Major Tom: "A most dangerous man indeed. His name is Yevgeny Borisovitch
           Volgin. His code name in the West is 'Thunderbolt.' He's gained a
           reputation as the most brutal and cold-blooded of the Soviet
           spymasters. During the war, Volgin was assigned to the domestic
           branch of the NKVD. He was stationed in the rear of the Soviet line
           to catch and punish any troops who tried to retreat or desert. He's
           also notorious for his 'accomplishments' in anti-guerilla operations
           in the Ukraine and the Baltic states. Apparently, he likes to boast
           that he 'disposed of' over 100,000 anti-communists. We also know 
           that he was instrumental in putting down the 1953 insurrection in
           East Germany and the 1956 uprising in Hungary. He is truly a 
           fearsome man. There's no telling what he might be plotting. Be
           careful."
Snake: "I will."

Snake: "Major, what's this Granin Design Bureau Sokolov was talking about?"
Major Tom: "OKB-812. It's the same type of top-secret facility as Sokolov's
           own OKB-754. The director is a man by the name of Aleksandr 
           Leonovitch Granin. He's Sokolov's archriva, and the two have
           competed fiercly against each other since the days of the war. To
           hear Sokolov tell it, though, the rivalry was really in Granin's
           head. In any case, Granin seems to harbor an unusually intense
           hatred for Sokolov. Knowing that Sokolov was protected under the
           aegis of Khrushchev, Granin threw in his lot with Volgin, the
           vanguard of the anti-Khrushchev movement. Apparently, Granin meant
           to use the funds provided by these opposition forces in order to
           defeat his old foe. Volgin, for his part, was intrigued by the
           possibility of using the high-tech weapons Granin created in the
           fight against Khrushchev. Thus, the two formed an alliance, and 
           Volgin took the Granin Design Bureau under his control."
Snake: "But now Volgin's got his sights set on Sokolov?"
Major Tom: "Yes. It would seem he and Granin aren't getting along so well after
           all."

Major Tom: "By the way, Snake, what were you doing back there?"
Snake: "Back where?"
Major Tom: "You were giving some kind of advice to a GRU commander, weren't
           you?"
Snake: "Yeah..."
Major Tom: "He's your enemy. What the hell were you think..."
Para-Medic: "Really! What was all that about doing the thing with your hand
            on the first round or whatever?"
Snake: "Mmm... Whenever he put a new clip in his gun he'd always load the first
       round by hand, whether there was a round left in the chamber or not. 
       It's a technique they teach in the Middle East. By making sure there's
       always a round in the chamber, you eliminate the risk of pulling the
       trigger with nothing to fire. He must have heard about it from someone,
       or read it somewhere...in any case, he probably wanted to try it out for
       himself. And he was obviously motivated by vanity to show off his new
       technique. That's when you make mistakes. The battlefield is an 
       unforgiving place. The only techniques you can rely on are the ones
       you've mastered through experience and practice."
Para-Medic: "Uh huh. And what were you saying about him being more suited to
            revolvers?"
Snake: "When he fired, he was bending his elbow sharply to avoid the recoil. It
       looked like he wasn't aware he was doing it, but that habit can be
       either a fatal flaw or a gift.
Para-Medic: "What do you mean?"
Snake: "Automatic weapons use recoil to operate, so if you don't let the recoil
       hit you, it interferes with the operating cycle of the gun. Basically,
       he shouldn't be trying to avoid the impact like that. But with a 
       revolver, thre's no need to let the recoil hit you. Just the opposite -
       avoiding the recoil lets you reduce the strain on your hand and arm.
       That kid might just be handy with a high-caliber revolver."
Para-Medic: "Handy...? Are you listening to yourself?"
Snake: "What do you mean?"
Para-Medic: "He's the enemy! Why are you giving him advice?"
Snake: "I..."
Para-Medic: "Snake?"
Snake: "...I don't know. For some reason, I couldn't help but point it out to
       him..."
Para-Medic: "...Snake, are you all right?"
Snake: "...Yeah..."

Para-Medic: "By the way, Snake."
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "What was that little lecture back there?"
Snake: "Lecture?"
Para-Medic: "You were instructing the GRU commander, weren't you? Something
            about the first round, or his hand."
Snake: "Yeah..."
Para-Medic: "What was that supposed to mean?"
Snake: "Mmm... Whenever he put a new clip in his gun he'd always load the first
       round by hand, whether there was a round left in the chamber or not. 
       It's a technique they teach in the Middle East. By making sure there's

08) Dremuchij North
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, your first task is to meet up with ADAM, the contact 
            provided by the KGB. The rendezvous point is the abandoned factory
            to the north of your current position. Head north."
Snake: "The abandoned factory...that's where I met Sokolov during the first
       Virtuous Mission."
Major Zero: "Correct. But we can't afford to have the same thing happen this
            time."
Snake: "I know."

---

Major Zero: "Like the Virtuous Mission, Operation Snake Eater is a solo
            sneaking mission. There are no units in the field to back you up.
            Avoid engaging the enemy whenever possible. Your first priority is
            to remain unseen. Use the 'CAMOUFLAGE' option in the Survival
            Viewer and choose your camouflage wisely. Proceed with caution."

---

Major Zero: "Unlike the Virtuous Mission, this is a night operation. You'll get
            lost more easily in the dark, but it will make your camouflage more
            effective and make it harder for the enemy to see you. On the other
            hand, it will also be more difficult for you to see them. You'll
            also find that different animals are active. Some of these 
            nocturnal animals are poisonous. So stay alert. Para-Medic is with
            us again to provide information on the local plants and animals.
            Give her a call if there's anything you need to know."

---

Major Zero: "Operation Snake Eater is different from the Virtuous Mission in
            that you won't be able to complete it in just a few hours. The time
            limit set by Khrushchev is one week. Within that time, you'll have
            to rescue Sokolov, defeat Volgin, destroy the Shagohod and..."
Snake: "I know."
Major Zero: "...Good. In any event, you will not be allowed to return until
            you've accomplished your objectives. Survival in the field will be
            critical in this mission. And the most important survival technique
            of all is, of course, finding food. You can get food in the same
            way you did during the Virtuous Mission - by capturing it. The 
            enemy presence in that area is still light. You should try and get
            as much food as possible while you can."

Major Zero: "Thanks to last week's nuclear incident, the Soviet Union is now
            on secondary alert. We're one step away from a nuclear war."
Snake: "Defcon 2, huh."
Major Zero: "In American parlance, yes. From what Western intelligence has been
            able to gather, the radical elements in the Soviet command are
            showing signs of impatience. They'll say we're on the brink of 
            World War III here. And with Khrushchev's position getting weaker
            every day, I worry whether he'll be able to hold them back..."
Snake: "...One week."
Major Zero: "Yes. America must eliminate The Boss by its own hand to prove its
            'innocence.' There is no other way to resolve the crisis. 
            Everything rests on your shoulders, Snake. Failure is not an
            option."
Snake: "...I know."

---

Snake: "Major, what should I do with this wreck of a drone?"
Major Zero: "Just leave it there."
Snake: "Are you sure?"
Major Zero: "Yes."
Snake: "But isn't this thing top secret?"
Major Zero: "Yeah, it is. After the U2 spy plane incident four years ago, plans
            were laid out for future spy missions in Soviet airspace to be
            carried out by an unmanned craft. That craft was the D21 spy drone,
            the basis of the one you came in on. The D21 is launched from a
            craft called the M21. The M21 itself is a derivative of the A-12, a
            supersonic long-range spy plane currently being developed as the
            successor to the U2. However, for this mission we used a modified
            YF-12A, a long-range interceptor version of the A-12. After being
            released from the mother ship, the drone can achieve speeds upwards
            of Mach 3 at high altitude using its ramjet engine. It can't be 
            shot down by ground-to-air missiles, and it's nearly undetectable
            by radar. With Tselinoyarsk in such a high state of alert after our
            last escapade, this was the only reliable way to get you in."
Snake: "This is all top-secret military technology. Are you telling me I'm 
       supposed to just leave it here?"
Major Zero: "That's right."
Snake: "Why?"
Major Zero: "The purpose of Operation Snake Eater is to send an American agent
            into the field in order to eliminate a defector and traitor -
            namely, The Boss. Part of that mission involves making sure the
            Soviets find out what we're doing."
Snake: "So we have to leave behind some kind of evidence that the U.S. was
       involved."
Major Zero: "Don't worry. The technologically sensitive components of the craft
            were rigged to self-destruct when it landed. The only thing the
            Soviets are going to find is a pile of American-made scrap metal."
Snake: "Got it. Just one thing, though."
Major Zero: "What is it?"
Snake: "I think they'd better redesign the landing impact buffer. People are
       gonna get hurt landing that thing."
Major Zero: "I'll let them know."

---

Snake: "Major, I appreciate you allowing me to use weapons, but shouldn't I be
       carrying some rubles?"
Major Zero: "You mean fake currency?"
Snake: "Right."
Major Zero: "Snake, do you remember the Francis Gary Powers incident back in
            1960? Powers was flying a U2 on a spy mission for the CIA in Soviet
            airspace. He was shot down and taken prisoner. His confession 
            brought to light the fact that the CIA was spying in Soviet 
            airspace. As a result, the U.S.-Soviet summit scheduled for two
            weeks later was canceled."
Snake: "Yeah, I remember."
Major Zero: "U2 pilots are required to carry items that mask their identity.
            Powers was carrying ruble, mark, and lira coins as well as French
            gold coins. He was also carrying two gold watches and seven women's
            rings. All of these objects were meant to conceal his national
            origins. But for this mission, we've got to demonstrate to the
            Khrushchev regime that America is involved. There's no need to
            conceal your origins. And besides... All you need to do is complete
            your mission. As long as you're not captured or killed, the details
            will take care of themselves."
Snake: "OK."

---

Major Zero: "The Soviet intelligence community must be up in arms about The
            Boss' defection. The great Voyevoda has abandoned America and
            embraced the Soviet Union."
Snake: "Voyevoda?"
Major Zero: "Apparently, that's what they call The Boss behind the Iron
            Curtain. It means 'warrior' or 'mighty soldier' in Russian. When
            used to refer to a women, it means something like 'lady knight.'
            In Russia, where they've had a number of female emperors throughout
            their history, it's a term of great respect. Well, poetic, in a
            way. The Boss' exploits have made her name famous in the East as
            well."

---

Snake: "Major, why did The Boss defect?"
Major Zero: "I don't know. But I will tell you this. America is all to eager to
            get rid of her."
Snake: "What do you mean?"
Major Zero: "She knows too many of our secrets. If she were to relay all the
            top-secret information she knows to the Soviet bloc, it would put
            us at a severe disadvantage. It might even lead to the downfall of
            the West. Even if we survive, The Boss is still too much of a hero
            to us. With her in the Soviet camp, we'd suffer a fatal loss of
            morale at home. There are even whispers that some of the less
            stalwart elements of the military might follow her example and
            defect themselves. I assume you're aware that since your last
            mission, several key figures within the CIA have been placed under
            house arrest."
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "The loss of The Boss has been a painful one indeed."
Snake: "What about you?"
Major Zero: "Me? I still can't believe it. As a comrade, I would have placed
            my trust in her before my own family. But now that I think about
            it, The Boss always seemed to have an aura of mystery about her.
            I never would have expected it to manifest in this way, though."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "Ah well, it won't do to get all misty-eyed about it. She's an
            enemy now, worthy of nothing more than our contempt."
Snake: "Understood."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, let's go over the controls for CQC one more time. Press the
            CQC Button once to throw a punch. Press it repeatedly to launch a
            combo attack. CQC doesn't really start to shine, however, until you
            grab an enemy. Press and hold the CQC Button to extend your right
            hand and grab the enemy. Move the left analog stick at the same 
            time and you can knock the enemy to the ground. If you don't move
            the left analog stick, you can get behind the enemy and hold him
            prisoner. When you're holding an enemy from behind, he'll be
            almost completely helpless. From there, there are a number of 
            things you can do. By pressing the CQC button again firmly, you
            can slit his throat using your knife. By moving the left analog
            stick with the CQC Button, you can knock him to the ground. You can
            also choke the enemy by tapping the CQC Button rapidly. You can
            either render him unconscious or kill him outright - it's up to
            you. If you keep the CQC Button pressed, you can use the left 
            analog stick to move around with the enemy in your grip. You can
            also press the Weapon Button to use the weapon you have equipped.
            The enemy will be hesitant to attack as long as you're using one
            of their comrades as a human shield. Use that moment of hesitation
            to attack in First Person View. By pressing the L3 Button, you can
            interrogate the enemy. You might be surprised at the things you can
            learn. But stay alert. While the enemy is nearly helpless in your
            grasp, if you give him a chance, he'll turn the tables on you. You
            can grab an enemy using CQC when you're using a weapon that will
            allow you to reach out with your right hand, such as a survival
            knife, a handgun, or your bare hands. You can't grab the enemy when
            using weapons that take both hands to use, such as assault rifles,
            or that prevent you from controlling the enemy with your right 
            hand, like hand grenades. In short, you can't use CQC when equipped
            with assault rifles or hand grenades. You can tell whether a weapon
            is compatible with CQC or not by looking at its icon."

Major Zero: "Snake, this is a solo sneaking mission. There are no medics there
            to assist you. You'll have to treat your own injuries. Are we
            clear?"
Snake: "I had a little bit of training, but I'm no doctor..."
Para-Medic: "That's where I come in. To treat an injury, first press the START
            button to open the Survival Viewer. Then select 'CURE' to start the
            treatment. Healing is divided into treatment using medicine with
            the Item Window Button and surgical treatment using the Weapon
            Window Button. Treatment with medicine involves administering oral
            remedies and serum injections. You'll use this treatment method
            when you have food poisoning or when you've been bitten by a 
            venomous animal. Surgical treatment involves applying surgical
            techniques to injured areas. You'll use this method to take care
            of burns and gunshot wounds. As long as you do everything you're
            supposed to, your injuries should heal completely. Be sure to 
            follow the proper procedures."

Snake: "Major."
Major Zero: "Yes?"
Snake: "I was just wondering...why do they call you 'Zero'?"
Major Zero: "What do you mean?"
Snake: "We go back a long ways, but I just realized I never asked you why
       you're called 'Zero'."
Major Zero: "You want to know where it comes from?"
Snake: "Yeah. If that's all right."
Major Zero: "...that's a bit nostalgic, really."
Snake: "Nostalgic?"
Major Zero: "The first British intelligence outfit was established in 1909.
            The head of the foreign intelligence division was a man named
            Mansfield George Smith Cumming. He was referred to simple as 'C,'
            after the first letter in his last name. Since then, out of respect
            for Cumming, the heads of the SIS have traditionally taken the name
            of 'C.'"
Para-Medic: "And James Bond's boss is called 'M.'"
Major Zero: "That's right. I myself was once known as 'O.'"
Snake: "And that's where 'Zero' comes from?"
Major Zero: "Precisely. In atother sense though, it signifies a ghost - one
            whose true identity must remain a mystery. The primogenitor of the
            solo sneaking operation."
Snake: "Is that so..."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, the food you catch will gradually spoil over time."
Para-Medic: "Some types of food spoil faster than others. Animal and fish meat
            goes bad relatively fast, but plants and mushrooms generally last
            a little longer. Animals won't go bad if you capture them alive,
            though. You can tell whether food has gone bad or not by looking
            closely at the icon on the 'FOOD' screen in the Survival Viewer. 
            So be sure to check the icon before you eat the food. If you eat
            spoiled food, you'll get sick and end up with a stomach ache. It'll
            get better eventually if you leave it alone, but that means you
            throw up and lose a lot of stamina. If you get a stomach ache, go
            to 'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and take some digestive medicine.
            Digestive medicine and antidotes aren't the only way to cure
            stomach aches and food poisoning. You can also induce vomiting.
            Go into the Survival Viewer and press the Viewer Button to enter
            Viewer Mode. Then rotate the right analog stick to spin your body
            around and eventually you'll start feeling queasy. When you get
            dizzy enough, exit the Survival Viewer and you'll throw up. That
            should get rid of any stomach ache and food poisoning you have. 
            Give it a try."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that's the home to the Otton frog. The Otton frog is a
            large, corpulent species of frog. They're known as a delicacy, so
            it might be worth catching them for food. The Otton frog was
            originally found only in Amami Oshima in Japan. Frogs usually have
            four toes on their front legs, but the Otton frog is unique in that
            it has five."
Snake: "Got it. By the way, you said they were a delicacy, right?"
Para-Medic: "Right."
Snake: "So that means they must be pretty good, huh?"
Para-Medic: "I guess so."
Snake: "I hear that in Japan, Otton frog sashimi and sukiyaki are popular
       dishes."
Para-Medic: "Really?"
Snake: "Yeah. Japan, huh...that place is starting to sound better and better."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is inhabited by the Japanese flying squirrel.
            Japanese flying squirrels are non-venomous, and they shouldn't
            attack you. The head, front legs, hind legs, and tail of the 
            Japanese flying squirrel are connected by a membrane of skin, which
            allows the squirrel to glide from tree to tree. It says here that
            if it catches a good wind, it can fly for more than 100 yards."
Snake: "Sounds like it's going to be a tough one to catch."
Para-Medic: "So aren't you going to ask me..."
Snake: "You know it. How does it taste?"
Para-Medic: "Not sure."
Snake: "Not sure?"
Para-Medic: "The guide doesn't say anything about it."
Snake: "Why not?"
Para-Medic: "Gee, maybe it's because no one would ever think of eating a
            flying squirrel."
Snake: "Then I must be the first one."
Para-Medic: "Maybe you are."

Para-Medic: "There should be a mushroom called the Baikal Scaly Tooth growing
            in that area. The Baikal Scaly Tooth mushroom is used as an
            antidote to poison. It usually grows on the trunks of trees, so 
            look for it there."
Snake: "How does it taste?"
Para-Medic: "I think you're going to be disappointed."
Snake: "Damn..."
Para-Medic: "Oh, quit your whining. You know what they say - good medicine
            tastes bitter."

Para-Medic: "There should be an herb called Chinese plantain growing in that
            area. The Chinese plantain is an herb that resembles a plantain
            root. The leaves and seeds contain large amounds of aucubin, 
            choline, and tannin. When you mash it up and apply it to a wound,
            it helps to stop the flow of blood and eases the pain a bit. The
            Chinese plantain becomes a styptic when you pick it up. If you see
            one, don't forget to take it with you."

Para-Medic: "Snake, I think there's a plant called Slav Horehound growing in
            that area. Slav Horehound is an herb in the horehound family. It
            contains large amounts of diterpene, flavonoids, and alkaloids,
            which give it strong germicidal properties. If you find one, it
            should make a good disinfectant."

---

Para-Medic: "You should be able to find Ezo Comfrey in that area. Ezo Comfrey
            is a plant in the Comfrey family that's found only in Tselinoyarsk.
            If you find one, you can use it as a cast to treat broken bones."
Snake: "How can a plant be turned into a splint?"
Para-Medic: "The roots of the Ezo Comfrey are extremely sticky. You can use
            them as a kind of plaster cast to fasten the affected area in
            place."
Snake: "I get it."

Para-Medic: "There's an herb called Amur Kudzu growing in that area. Amur Kudzu
            is a member of the bean family and a close relative of the Kudzu
            weed. The roots contain a number of isoflavones such as daidzin,
            which give it strong fever-reducing properties. It'll make a good
            cold medicine if you find some."

Para-Medic: "When you're bitten by a venomous animal such as a snake or spider,
            or hit by a poisoned arrow, the poison will start to affect your
            body. Your LIFE will decrease with each passing minute, so cure the
            poison as soon as possible. To cure poison, go into 'CURE' in the
            Survival Viewer and inject yourself with a dose of serum. You can
            get serum from enemies. Either hold them up or shake their bodies
            down after you defeat them. I'm pretty sure you can also get
            serum by capturing the rabbits that live in that area."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, be careful when you approach the enemy. The closer you are
            to them, the more accurate their shots will be, and the more damage
            their weapons will do. That means you've got a greater chance of
            getting seriously wounded. Daring frontal assaults are not a good
            idea. But if you do get seriously injured, go into the Survival
            Viewer and treat it immediately."

---

Para-Medic: "When you get shot, sometimes you'll suffer a gunshot wound. The
            chance of suffering a serious injury is especially high at close
            range. When you have a gunshot wound, your maximum LIFE will
            decrease depending on its severity. Gunshot wounds will heal
            naturally over time, but if you want it to heal faster, go into
            'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and treat it. To treat a gunshot
            wound, you need to dig out the bullet with your knife, disinfect
            the wound, and apply styptic. Then wrap it in a bandage. When all
            that's finished, the gunshot wound will be fully healed."

---

Para-Medic: "Burns happen when you're engulfed in flames or get caught in an
            explosion. When you've got a burn, your maximum LIFE will go down
            depending on its severity. Burns heal naturally over time without
            you doing anything, but if you go into 'CURE' in the Survival
            Viewer and treat the burn, you can heal it instantaneously. To
            treat the burn, lightly spread the ointment over the wound and wrap
            it in bandages. If you do both of these things, you can heal the 
            burn altogether."

Para-Medic: "Snake, I...Ah!"
Snake: "?"
Para-Medic: "H...hello there."
Snake: "Para-Medic, it's me."
Para-Medic: "Snake? Oh, it's you. For a minute there, I thought you were
            someone else..."
Snake: "Why are you so nervous? You've seen this mask before, right?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah, but it looks so cool..."
Snake: "Huh?"
Para-Medic: "Cool. You know? Kind of like a Venusian."
Snake: "A Venusian...?"
Para-Medic: "I mean, not the crab kind...the other kind."
Snake: "Para-Medic, do you really think a guy you've never seen before would
       suddenly call you on this frequency?"
Para-Medic: "I know, it sounds ridiculous. But still... What if it was a
            being from another planet? You can't rule out that possibility."
Snake: "..."

Sigint: "Yo! You're Snake aren't you?"
Snake: "And you're Sigint?"
Sigint: "None other."
Snake: "I heard you are an expert on weapons, equipment and cutting-edge
       technology."
Sigint: "Close..."
Snake: "?"
Sigint: "I am THE expert on weapons, equipment, and cutting-edge technology."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "I'm the guy that designed your tranq. gun, active sonar, and motion
        detector. If you want to know anything about weapons or equipment you
        find in the field, just SEND me a message and ask. Later!"

Sigint: "Sounds like the Cobra Unit's members' names came from the specific
        emotions they each carry into battle."
Snake: "Emotions?"
Sigint: "Yeah. For unbearable torment, The Pain. For true oblivion, The End.
        For infinite rage, The Fury. For absolute terror, The Fear. And for
        unsurpassed bliss, The Joy."
Snake: "The Joy?"
Sigint: "It's another name for The Boss. Because of the boy she feels in
        battle, I suppose."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "During the war, she had a partner named The Sorrow. Sorrow and Joy.
        They say there couldn't have been a more perfect pair."

Sigint: "The Davy Crocketts that The Boss took with her when she defected are
        mortars that fire nuclear warhead. They're named after Davy Crockett,
        the hero who died defending the Alamo in the Texan War of 
        Independance."
Snake: "'Remember the Alamo.'"
Sigint: "That's right. The warheads are equivalent to between 10 and 20 tons of
        TNT. Every building within 150 yards of the hypocenter is completely
        obliterated. But the warheads The Boss had with her were some kind of
        experimental super-bomb. So they're actually more powerful than that. I
        don't even want to think about what'd happen if she used it again.
        Snake, you know what you have to do..."
Snake: "Yeah... I know."

Sigint: "Hey, you've got an M1911A1."
Snake: "Yeah, a .45. Fifty years since the Army adopted the first model, and
       they're still using them."
Sigint: "It's a real gem of an automatic pistol. But aren't you going to need
        more than just one little handgun?"
Snake: "Not at all."
Sigint: "When you're in a tight spot or fighting in close quarters, sometimes
        a handgun works better than a rifle. And if I equip a knife at the same
        time, I can instantaneously switch over to hand-to-hand combat."
Sigint: "I see."

Sigint: "You're wearing the tiger stripe pattern camouflage, huh? Tiger stripe
        is a forest camouflage. As you may have guessed by the name, it mimics
        the stripe pattern on a tiger's coat. It was originally worn by South
        Vietnamese Marines. Then it caught the attention of an American
        military advisor, and now they're thinking of introducing it into all
        kinds of special forces units. It works best in places with lots of
        trees and grass, but it should blend in with dirt and mud, too."

---

Sigint: "Covering your body is a good start, but a bare face will kill even the
        best camouflage. If the situation calls for a high Camo Index, you'd
        better break out the face paint. To apply face paint, select 'FACE' 
        from the 'CAMOUFLAGE' menu in the Survival Viewer. Then, choose a face
        paint that blends in with your surroundings."

---

Sigint: "I heard you fought against KGB troops in the Virtuous Mission. But 
        this time you're up against Spetsnaz. Spetsnaz is the special forces
        unit of GRU, the intelligence wing of teh Soviet Defense Ministry's
        General Staff Office. Spetsnaz troops undergo rigorous training in all
        types of special ops, from assassination and demolition to intelligence
        gathering. That, and Volgin's loaded, man. His unit is one of the best
        equipped in the entire Soviet Union, if not THE best. I heard the
        enemies you encountered in the Virtuous Mission were only carrying
        weapons like AKs and grenades. Well, it ain't that simple anymore. In
        addition to AKs, some of the patrols you'll encounter might be equipped
        with Scorpion submachine guns and shotguns. The Scorpion is even
        lighter than the AK, making it much easier to handle. Basically, a guy
        with a Scorpion is not gonna miss you as often as with an AK. The 
        shotgun is a powerful weapon. One blast is enough to floor you and 
        you're likely to be seriously wounded. Watch for that, man."

---

Sigint: "When you fire continuously with a gun like the assault rifle, the
        recoil will cause your shots to veer off target. But if you crouch or
        lie down, you can suppress the recoil and keep a tight fire pattern. So
        when you gotta hit that bull's eye, take a low position."

Sigint: "Splitter is an indoor face paint. Painting your face with splitter
        should help you blend in better when you're infiltrating a building."

Sigint: "I see you're using binoculars. Those are high-performance binoculars
        made especially for the military. They're completely waterproof and are
        filled with nitrogen gas to prevent lens fog. The eyepiece, objective
        lends and the prism have been coated to reduce glare. They ought to
        work plenty well even in dark places. And they're even equipped with
        auto-focus and zoom functions. Won't find a better pair of binoculars
        than that."
Snake: "What are you, a binoculars salesman?"
Sigint: "Hey, I know a good product when I see one, that's all."
Snake: "...?"

Sigint: "Snake, you smoking a cigarette?"
Snake: "It's not a cigarette. It's a cigar."
Sigint: "Ah, same thing."
Snake: "It's not the same thing."
Sigint: "Doesn't matter to me. What I want to know is, why'd you take it with
        you?"
Snake: "Because I need it."
Sigint: "For what?"
Snake: "I can't smoke a cigar if I don't have one, can I?"
Sigint: "So you just wanted to smoke it?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Sigint: "...Man, you got problems. Do what you want. Just keep in mind that
        your LIFE goes down while you're smoking it."

Sigint: "Using the anti-personnel sensor, I see. The sensor vibrates when it
        detects organic reations from human targets. It's been adjusted to
        respond only to humans, so unlike other sensors, it'll let you ignore
        animals and focus only on the enemy. It'll even detect enemies that
        aren't moving, and you won't have to worry about it giving away your
        position. But on the flip side, it won't tell you the exact location 
        of the target. Keep that in mind when you're using it. Also, remember
        that when you use it in First Person View, it'll only scan in the
        direction you're facing."
Snake: "?"
Sigint: "Something wrong?"
Snake: "The Major told me the exact same thing..."
Sigint: "You mean during the Virtuous Mission?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Sigint: "He must have been reading those notes I gave him word for word. That
        guy doesn't know tech."
Snake: "..."

---

Sigint: "The motion detector will display any moving objects in your vicinity.
        But the enemy isn't the only thing that's moving around in the jungle.
        If there are animals moving nearby, the sensor will pick up those
        animals, too. And remember that there's a limit to how sensitive it is.
        Enemies and animals that don't move around very much won't get picked
        up. Did he tell you that, too?"
Snake: "Yeah. Did you give him notes for it?"
Sigint: "Yep."
Snake: "..."

---

Sigint: "Active sonar sends out a special type of sound wave whenever you
        press the L3 button. It uses the echo from those waves to calculate
        and display the position of nearby objects. Unlike the motion detector,
        it'll show you the objects that aren't moving. But because you're
        blasting out sound waves, there's a risk that the noise will alert
        enemies and animals to your presence. Be careful about when and where
        you use it."
Snake: "I've heard that one, too."
Sigint: "Did he use the exact same words?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Sigint: "Man, that guy lives in the Stone Age. Just the other day, he bought
        this brand-new washing machine, and..."
Major Tom: "Sigint!"
Sigint: "...Oops. Talk to you later, Snake."

---

Sigint: "Hmm, I've never seen a grenade like that one before. There are two
        basic types of grenades: fragmentation grenades, which use shrapnel
        to kill or maim the target, and explosive grenades, which use the blast
        from the explosion as the offensive means. But the grenade you've got
        there isn't either of those. My best guess is that it's meant to knock
        the enemy out without hurting them. Most likely it's an entirely new
        kind of weapon developed exclusively at Groznyj Grad. I've heard that
        the SAS is working on a low-impact grenade for training purposes...but
        I never thought they'd be used in an actual battle... The flash of 
        light that occurs when the grenade explodes is probably produced by
        magnesium. It's the same stuff that's used in camera flashes. I'm
        thinking they cut down on killing power by reducing the amount of
        explosives and made up for it by making the flash and bang so strong
        that it overwhelms the enemy's senses. I guess you could call it a 
        'stun grenade.'"
Snake: "If I'm going to be stunned, I'd rather it be by a woman."
Sigint: "Snap out of it. Anyone around when that thing goes off'll be laid out.
        It ought to come in handy when you're trying to storm a room, or when
        you don't want to kill the enemy."

---

Sigint: "The black uniform isn't really camouflage. It was intended to have a
        psychological shock effect on enemies in hostage-rescue operations and
        stuff like that. But it should also make you pretty hrad to see if you
        wear it in a dark environment. And it might work on black, earthy
        surfaces like you'd find in swamps."

---

Sigint: "Patterned clothing, facepaint, tactical movements - these are the
        elements of camouflage that will allow you to deceive your enemy. To
        camouflage yourself, first press the START button to check out the
        Survival Viewer. Then select 'CAMOUFLAGE' and you'll see two more
        options: 'FACE' and 'UNIFORM'. Choose 'FACE' to apply face paint, and
        'UNIFORM' to change your field uniform. Simple really. Make sure and
        choose something that'll match your surroundings."

---

Sigint: "Squares is a mountain camo that's basically a bunch of square
        patterns. It might look conspicuous at first glance, but it actually
        blurs the contours of the person wearing it and makes them more 
        difficult to pick out. It should give you a low profile against reddish
        backgrounds, like bricks and rusty metal."

---

Sigint: "The Camo Index, located in the top right corner of the screen, tells
        you if your outfit is gettin' the job done. The higher the value of
        this index, the harder it is for the enemy to spot you. Try your best
        to keep the Camo Index as high as possible."

Snake: "Tell me something, Sigint..."
Sigint: "What's that?"
Snake: "What does 'Sigint' mean, anyway?"
Sigint: "It's short for 'Signal Intelligence.'"
Snake: "Signal Intelligence?"
Sigint: "The part of intelligence that deals with electronic information.
        Things like intercepting and analyzing electronic communications,
        determining enemy force strength and positioning from radar emissions
        and radio chatter - you get the idea. Codebreaking is considered part
        of SIGINT as well. 40 years from now, we'll be in the age of electronic
        warfare. It won't be long before information replaces firepower as the
        most valuable commodity on the battlefield."
Snake: "So you're saying they won't need guys like me anymore?"
Sigint: "Sorry to break it to you, but that's not gonna happen. No matter how
        advanced our technology gets, there's still no substitute for human
        beings."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "Anyway, the major is a man of foresight. He knew the electronic age
        was coming, and so he called out to me."
Snake: "And you responded."
Sigint: "Well, I didn't have anyplace else to do."
Snake: "You couldn't find a job?"
Sigint: "Nope. None of the places where they do this kind of high-tech
        research would even let me in the door."
Snake: "Why not? I know you've got social problems, but..."
Sigint: "Come again?"
Snake: "Nothing. I mean, someone with your talent ought to be able to...
Sigint: "Yeah, well, maybe it had something to do with the fact that I'm
        black."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "The major, though, he doesn't care about what color you are. I've 
        never met anyone like him before. He's...different, you know?"
Snake: "Oh, yeah, I know."
Sigint: "I don't think racism's going to go away even in the 21st century. But
        I want to work with computers and use them to bring people closer
        together. In the digital world, it doesn't matter whether you're black
        or white, American or Russian, or whatever. Everybody's going to be the
        same. That's what I think."

---

Sigint: "Eh? You're not wearing any face paint? You can take off your face
        paint by selecting 'NO PAINT' from 'FACE'. Just select 'NO PAINT' when
        you want to skip wearing any face paint at all. But your Camo Index is
        never going to be as high without face paint as it is with it. Unless
        you want the enemy to see you, you ought to be wearing face paint."

---

Sigint: "Your field uniform is not just a set of threads to wear. To get the
        max-effect out of your camouflage, you gotta correspond with your
        environment. So no matter where you are, make sure to choose a camo
        pattern that lets you blend in."

---

Sigint: "You're on a solo sneaking mission. Your success is based on your
        ability to survive. That's where the Survival Viewer comes in. The
        Survival Viewer contains everything you need to survive out in the
        field. Use 'CAMOUFLAGE' to change your camouflage, and 'BACKPACK' to
        select your gear. Use 'FOOD' to eat, 'CURE' to treat wounds, and 'MAP'
        to view a detail of the area. You've also got 'OPTIONS' that lets you
        change the settings to suit your mission preferences. Got it?"

---

Sigint: "Snake, what's up? Why are you naked? I know there's a 'NAKED' option
        under 'UNIFORM' that lets you take off the upper part of your uniform.
        But without a shirt on, your camouflage sucks, and your stamina goes
        down faster. You don't get any advantages whatsoever."
Snake: "Sure there are."
Sigint: "Like what?"
Snake: "It feels good."
Sigint: "...Man, you do whatever you want."
Snake: "I will, thanks. Just one question, though."
Sigint: "What?"
Snake: "Is there a way to take off my pants?"
Sigint: "Say WHAT!?"
Snake: "My pants, can I..."
Sigint: "Ah, hell no! This FOX unit is a nut fest!"

---

Sigint: "I see you're wearing the olive drab uniform. Olive drab, or O.D. for
        short, is the standard battle uniform of G.I.s. It's a solid-color 
        outfit with no camouflage pattern, so naturally it's not going to be
        much use as camouflage. I'd change into something else as soon as
        possible if I were you.

---

Sigint: "Wearing black face paint, huh? Painting your face with black face
        paint should give you a high rate of camouflage in dark areas."

---

Sigint: "Wearing the leaf pattern camouflage, are you? Leaf pattern is a forest
        camouflage created to provide cover in woodland areas. Now that our
        involvement in Vietnam looks set to expand, they're thinking about
        adopting it for official use. It'll help you blend in especially well
        when you're hiding in the bushes."

---

Sigint: "So you're wearing the tree bark camouflage. Tree bark is a forest
        pattern created primarily for use by hunters. It'll give you an
        exceptionally low profile if you wear it when you're pressed up
        against a tree."

---

Sigint: "Ah, you're wearing the mask. I made it myself. Pretty good work,
        don't you think? A while back they were planning to disguise someone
        as this one GRU officer and send them in to steal some secret 
        documents. I created the mask for that operation. But then the mission
        ended up being canceled... And then the major came and told me to throw
        it out? Can you believe that guy?"
Snake: "But you didn't throw it out."
Sigint: "Are you kidding? Tossing a superior quality product like that into the
        garbage without using it would be an insult to science. So decided to
        sneak it into your gear."
Snake: "OK...but is it really that big of a deal?"
Sigint: "Of course it is."
Snake: "What's so great about it?"
Sigint: "Everything. But if I had to pick one reason, I'd have to say it's
        because it's the first mask ever that can blink its eyes."
Snake: "What about the lips?"
Sigint: "What's that?"
Snake: "Can it open its mouth?"
Sigint: "Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Snake. You're crazy, man."
Snake: "I'm serious..."
Sigint: "Are you even listening to me, Snake? Where's your common sense!? Damn!
Snake: "S...sorry...????"

Sigint: "Whenever you find a new weapon or piece of equipment, the first thing
        you do is drop it in your backpack, right? But you can't use your new
        goodies if they're just sittin' in your backpack. To use a weapon or a
        piece of equipment, first you have to take it out of your backpack and
        place it on your person. To take an item out of your backpack, use the
        'BACKPACK' option in the Survival Viewer."

Major Zero: "ADAM is waiting for you at the abandoned factory to the north of
            your current position. Head north."

Major Zero: "The enemy must have seen the drone explode. They've probably 
            already sent out patrol units. You never know when you'll
            encounter the enemy. Use your camouflage wisely and proceed with
            caution."

---

Snake: "Major, why was The Boss there...did they detect my infiltration?"
Major Zero: "That's impossible. The drone shouldn't have been picked up by
            their radar at all."
Snake: "Then how did she know? It couldn't have been...?"
Major Zero: "That's also out of the question. We've taken all measures to 
            ensure this mission stays secret."
Snake: "...Then what's going on?"
Major Zero: "I don't know."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "It won't do you any good to dwell on it, Snake. Hurry to your
            rendezvous with ADAM. Head for the abandoned factory to the north.
            Watch out for enemy patrols. Stay alert at all times. OK?"

Snake: "Major..."
Major Zero: "What is it?"
Snake: "...Why did The Boss betray us?"
Major Zero: "Leave it alone, Snake."
Snake: "But..."
Major Zero: "We've been through this before. Besides, asking for reasons now
            won't change anything."
Snake: "I thought I'd find out if I met her face to face. I thought for sure
       she'd tell me. But..."
Major Zero: "Then you'll have to find your own answers."
Snake: "...By completing my 'mission'?"
Major Zero: "Yes."
Snake: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, whatever happens to you, make sure you leave a descendant,
            OK?"
Snake: "Are you saying you want to have my baby?"
Para-Medic: "No. I'm saying that in the 21st century, the genes of soldiers 
            like you are going to be in high demand."
Snake: "Genes?"
Para-Medic: "Uh huh. Remember when Watson and Crick discovered the double helix
            structure of DNA back in 1953?"
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "You know, they won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for it the year
            before last? Of course, you have to feel sorry for Pauling and
            Franklin. They were researching the exact same thing."
Snake: "Sorry. I don't follow."
Para-Medic: "Inside every living creature are little blueprints called genes.
            Through the union of the sperm and egg cells, these blueprints are
            transformed and inherited by the next generation. That's why 
            parents and children resemble each other. The concept of genes was
            first proposed over a hundred years ago by Mendel, but he didn't
            know what they were exactly. For a while, it was thought that
            chromosomes were composed not of deoxyribonucleic acid, but of
            proteins called polypeptides. Later, it was shown that
            deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a biological macromolecule. 
            Then, 11 years ago, Watson and Crick discovered that DNA had a
            double-helix structure."
Snake: "This is all fascinating stuff, but what exactly does it have to do 
       with me?"
Para-Medic: "The inherent characteristics of any given individual are 
            determined by his or her genes. By duplicating a set of superior
            genes, a separate body with the same set of characteristics - a
            clone - can be created."
Snake: "But genes don't control a person's fate."
Para-Medic: "That's true. But having an offspring that's genetically identical
            to the parent is more efficient, right? You can expect better 
            results that way."
Snake: "More efficient? You can't mass-produce human beings!"
Para-Medic: "Maybe. But now that we know the true nature of genes, human
            cloning is that much closer to reality. Nuclear transplanting is
            already theoretically possible. So one day..."
Snake: "My genes are going to be a valuable commodity?"
Para-Medic: "Exactly."
Snake: "They'd never let that happen."
Para-Medic: "Just think - even if your body dies, you survive and go on to
            bigger and better accomplishments. If you think about it, it's kind
            of an honor."
Snake: "Does that kind of technology seriously appeal to you?"
Para-Medic: "Well, I am a doctor."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "I can't condone it on moral grounds, but I'm fascinated by the
            possibilities. Especially when I see such an excellent specimin as
            yourself."
Snake: "Yeah, well, thanks for the compliment, but it doesn't make me feel any
       better."
Para-Medic: "Don't be so glum. It's not like it's going to happen anytime
            soon."
Snake: "We'll just have to wait and see."

Para-Medic: "Cuts happen when you get slashed with a knife or other sharp
            object. When you have a cut, your maximum LIFE goes down depending
            on its severity. Cuts heal naturally over time, but if you go into
            'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and treat it, it'll heal 
            instantaneously. To treat a cut, you need disinfectant, styptic,
            sutures, and a bandage. As long as you have all those things, the 
            cut should heal up nicely.

Para-Medic: "Snake, king cobras are making their home in the area you're in
            now. The king cobra is the world's largest venomous snake. Its
            large size means that it has a lot of venom to inject. One bite is
            supposedly enough to kill an elephant. And its extremely vicious as
            well, so watch out. If you get bitten by a king cobra and injected
            with venom, your LIFE will start to decrease rapidly. As soon as
            you're bitten, go into the Survival Viewer and use 'CURE' to give
            yourself a serum injection. The king cobra's diet consists mostly
            of other snakes. Be careful or you might end up as its next meal."
Snake: "Got it. So...?"
Para-Medic: "What -- How does it taste?"
Snake: "Yep."
Para-Medic: "It seems you're the one whose diet consists of other snakes."
Snake: "You're making me blush."
Para-Medic: "...The guide says they taste just fine."
Snake: "Mmm."
Para-Medic: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is inhabited by the green tree python. The green
            tree python isn't venomous, so no need to worry. It's fairly 
            docile, too, so I don't think it's likely to attack you. The green
            tree python originally comes from Australia and New Zealand. It's a
            really pretty green color, and it lives... Oh my God..."
Snake: "What's wrong?"
Para-Medic: "Snake, what did I just say?"
Snake: "They come from Australia and New Zealand?"
Para-Medic: "No, after that."
Snake: "They're a really pretty green color."
Para-Medic: "I thought so. What was I thinking? Seeing a snake and calling it
            'pretty'..."
Snake: "What's wrong with that?"
Para-Medic: "Everything! When a normal woman sees a snake, she's supposed to
            scream or get sick or something like that."
Snake: "And you think you're normal?"
Para-Medic: "What was that!?"
Snake: "Nothing."
Para-Medic: "Ooh, it's all your fault!!"
Snake: "Geez, I'm sorry. But enough of that..."
Para-Medic: "What do you mean, enough of that? This is serious!"
Snake: "No, I... I just wanted you to tell me how it tastes."
Para-Medic: "How should I know!?"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "...It was awfully pretty, though..."

            you can heal them right away by going into 'CURE' in the Survival

Para-Medic: "You'll catch a cold if you hang around too long without any
            clothes on, or spend too much time in the water or the swamp.
            When you catch a cold, your stamina goes down much more rapidly.
            You'll also sneeze from time to time, and the noise can alert 
            enemies to your presence. Plus, your body will shake, so you might
            not be able to distinguish vibrations very well. To cure a cold, go
            into 'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and take some cold medicine."

Para-Medic: "Leeches will sometimes attach themselves to you if you spend a 
            long time in the water or the swamp. When you've got leeches on
            you, they'll suck your blood, causing you to lose stamina. You
            should get rid of them as soon as possible. To get rid of leeches,
            go into 'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and press your cigar into
            them. Or, if you use the insecticidal bug juice ahead of time, the
            leeches won't bother you as long as the bug juice is in effect."

Para-Medic: "Snake, I've been looking at your medical record... You've been
            exposed to an atomic blast?"
Snake: "Yeah. The 'Bravo Shot.' It was a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll on
       March 1, 1954. I was at the American base on Kwajalein in the Marshall
       Islands when the ashes of death started falling from the sky."
Para-Medic: "...Any symptoms?"
Snake: "None...at least not yet. But a lot of the guys who were in it with me
       are now suffering from thyroid cancer and leukemia. Some of them are
       dead already."

Para-Medic: "Snake, there's supposed to be a tsuchinoko in that area."
Snake: "Tsuchinoko?"
Para-Medic: "You've never heard of it? It's a mysterious snake that's found all
            over Japan."
Snake: "If it lives all over Japan, then why is it so mysterious?"
Para-Medic: "Many people have seen them, but no one's ever caught one. If you
            do manage to catch one, it'll be a major historic discovery. You
            should look for it!"
Snake: "If I have time. So what kind of snake is this 'tsuchinoko'?"
Para-Medic: "The body is about as thick as a beer bottle, and the tail tapers
            off to a point. It doesn't slither around like other snakes, but
            rather goes in a straight line like an inchworm. Sometimes it even
            jumps several yards at a time. It's got sinister looking eyes, and
            it can even blink and move its eyes around. It's also been known to
            snore, cry, and stand up straight on its tail."
Snake: "And this is an actual snake?"
Para-Medic: "Of course."
Snake: "Uh huh. Then how come you seem to know so much about them? Is it in
       that guide of yours?"
Para-Medic: "No."
Snake: "Then maybe you saw it in a movie, like 'Curse of the 50-Foot
       Tsuchinoko' or something."
Para-Medic: "There's no such movie. I heard about it from Sigint."
Snake: "Sigint?"
Para-Medic: "He's an expert on UMAs."
Snake: "UMAs?"
Para-Medic: "Unidentified Mysterious Animals, dummy."
Snake: "Oh, excuse my ignorance... Why does he know so much about them?"
Para-Medic: "Probably because he likes them. At the CIA, he was the vice
            president of an unofficial group called the 'UMA Watcher Club.'"
Snake: "The UMA Watcher Club?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. Just the other day he was working on the newsletter at his
            desk."
Snake: "At the office? How does he get away with that...?"
Para-Medic: "Well, the major is the chairman of the club."

Major Zero: "You've arrived at the factory, I see."
Snake: "Yeah. Now to meet up with this ADAM guy."
Major Zero: "Good, go to it."
Snake: "So where is he?"
Major Zero: "We weren't given an exact location."
Snake: "How about a time?"
Major Zero: "Nothing was specified."
Snake: "A physical description."
Major Zero: "I'm not sure."
Snake: "...How am I supposed to find him, then?"
Major Zero: "You won't need to."
Snake: "?"
Major Zero: "He'll find you."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "Why don't you try the room to the northeast where you met Sokolov?
            ADAM might be in there."

---

Major Zero: "ADAM is a spy sent by the KGB to infiltrate Volgin's ranks. You'll
            need to be extremely careful in how you approach him."
Snake: "Obviously. He can't let Volgin know he's meeting me."
Major Zero: "That's right. ADAM won't show up if you're being pursued by the
            enemy. Before you go to rendezvous with ADAM, make sure you haven't
            been seen by the enemy. Meet up with him in Normal Phase. Got it?"

Sigint: "Got yourself an AK-47, huh? The AK-47 is the official assault rifle
        of the Soviet army. The first model was completed in 1946, and in '49
        it beat out all its competitors to become the standard assault rifle
        of the Soviet military. It uses 7.62 mm x 39 rounds, developed in 1943,
        and a 30-round box magazine originally designed for a different assault
        rifle. You can aim it from the shoulder by equipping it in First Person
        View and holding down the Aim Button. It's sturdy and extremely 
        reliable, with high power and precision. There's no better assault
        rifle in the world."

Sigint: "Uh, Snake...what are you doing?"
Snake: "I'm in a box."
Sigint: "A cardboard box? Why are you...?"
Snake: "I dunno. I was just looking at it, and suddenly I got this irresistable
       urge to get inside. No, not an urge - more than that. It was my destiny
       to be here; in the box."
Sigint: "Destiny...?"
Snake: "Yeah. And then when I put it on, I suddenly got this feeling of inner
       peace. I can't put it into words. I feel...safe. Like this is where I 
       was meant to be. Like I'd found the key to true happiness. ... Does that
       make any sense?"
Sigint: "Not even a little."
Snake: "You should come inside the box... Then you'll know what I mean."
Sigint: "Man, I don't wanna know what you mean! Between you and Para-Medic, is
        everyone but me that is hooked up with the Major strange!?"
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "Yeah, well, anyway, I suppose even that dumbass box might make a 
        decent disguise if you wear it inside a building."

Sigint: "Snake, your face paint, it's..."
Snake: "I know. It's called zombie."
Sigint: "Zombie? What does that mean?"
Snake: "Beats me."
Para-Medic: "Are you serious!?"
Sigint: "Hello, Para-Medic..."
Para-Medic: "You mean you've never heard of zombies?"
Snake: "Nope."
Sigint: "Never."
Para-Medic: "You guys don't know anything. A zombie is a dead body that's been
            cursed and brought back to life by a master of black magic.
            Supposedly, they revive the dead and use them as slaves. It's also
            seen as a kind of punishment - people who commit terrible crimes 
            can be forced to labor even after they're dead."
Snake: "Interesting...how do you know all this stuff?"
Para-Medic: "I saw it in movies. Like 'White Zombie.' Never seen it?"
Snake: "Nope."
Sigint: "Can't say I have."
Para-Medic: "How about 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'?"
Snake: "No."
Sigint: "Missed it."
Para-Medic: "You can't just focus on the things you like all the time. You
            have to expand your horizons, try new things. You guys need to
            get out more."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "...Yeah, well, anyway, that face paint doesn't look that useful. Go
        ahead and wear it if you want, but I think you should change to..."
Para-Medic: "You don't need to change anything."
Sigint: "Why not?"
Para-Medic: "It makes him look awesome."
Sigint: "..."
Para-Medic: "Doesn't it?"
Sigint: "Look, arguing about it isn't going to get us anywhere. Snake, you do
        whatever you want."
Para-Medic: "It does make you look cool!"

Sigint: "Using the mine detector, huh? When you equip the mine detector, it
        lets you know with a sound if there are any Claymore mines nearby. A
        mine detector is basically a metal detector, so ordinarily it reacts
        to scrap iron the same way it reacts to mines. They say that only about
        one of every 100 objects it responds to is an actual mine. Not exactly
        what you'd call reliable. So they're researching other ways to detect
        mines, like sniffing for molecules given off by explosives and using a
        kind of underground radar. One of these days, they might actually make
        something that works. But the one you're using is apparently set up so
        that it only reacts when it finds a Claymore on the ground. No need to
        worry about it being fooled by anything other than a mine."

Sigint: "Hey...what's that you've got there?"
Snake: "Thermal goggles. From what I can tell, they detect and display sources
       of heat."
Sigint: "You're kiddin' me! They actually made a passive infrared night-vision
        device small enough to carry around with you..."
Snake: "What, is that special or something?"
Sigint: "Is it special? Here in the West, we've just barely got the technology
        to install it on aircraft."
Snake: "So that's what the thing they put on the gunship... But doesn't the 
       Army have something like that for driving vehicles at night? I thought
       I saw..."
Sigint: "You mean the AN-PAS-5. That's an active infrared night-vision device.
        It fires infrared beams from an infrared projector, and uses the
        reflections to build an image. Those goggles you've got there are
        completely different. Basically, when you've got those equipped, you'll
        be able to spot enemy soldiers in the jungle with ease, even if they're
        camouflaged. They might even help you find traps. Ah, but you won't be
        able to see the terrain as well, so watch your step."

12) Rassvet, during Ocelot sting
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "It appears you've been completely surrounded."
Snake: "Yeah. So I gathered."
Major Zero: "If EVA is to escape from there..."
Snake: "Right. I'll take them all out."
Major Zero: "Snake, you must defeat all the Ocelots. That's the only way to
            ensure EVA's safe escape, as well as your own. But you're up 
            against a lot of them. Don't try to take them head on. Approach
            them without being seen, and dispatch them one by one. And don't
            forget to use your camouflage."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, don't try to engage the Ocelots head on. There are too
            many of them. If they surround you, you'll be finished. Use your
            camouflage to approach them without being seen, and take them out
            one by one."

---

Major Zero: "If you don't camouflage yourself properly, you run the risk of
            being spotted and attacked by snipers or other far away enemies.
            Don't forget to use the 'CAMOUFLAGE' screen in the Survival Viewer
            to disguise yourself. Always maintain a high Camo Index."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, enemy soldiers who move in file pose a serious threat. Try
            to take them out one at a time starting with the one at the back."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, there were drums filled with fuel at the factory. If you
            shoot a bullet into one of those drums, the resulting explosion
            should send any nearby enemies flying. Use them to your advantage!"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, there's no telling where the enemy might be hiding. Be sure
            to check the ceilings and the bushes. Don't let your guard down,
            even for an instant."

---

Major Zero: "EVA needs you to distract the enemies until she can escape on her
            motorcycle. She's probably out there somewhere waiting for her
            chance. Don't worry about her. Focus on defeating the enemy.
            Understood?"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, it appears they've got snipers in place. Snipers are
            excellent shots. If they hit you, you're likely to be wounded. 
            Find the snipers and neutralize them before they can shoot you. If
            you do get shot at, take cover behind something. Understood?"

---

Sigint: "Those rifles the Ocelots are using aren't AK-47s, are they?"
Snake: "No. They kind of look like AKMs, but they're different."
Sigint: "Different how?"
Snake: "They've got steel hand guards and vertical-type foregrips. And the
       muzzle suppressor is bigger."
Sigint: "A carbine version of the AKM, huh. Hungary has a unique modified
        version of the AKM called the AMD-63. I heard something before about
        them making a prototype carbine version of that. My guess is they
        probably imported some of these prototypes. If they're using a carbine
        version of the AMD-63 like I'm thinkin', then they could be a serious
        threat. Those things handle better than AK-47s, especially at close
        range. And don't forgot the Ocelots are elites. They're going to be
        better shots than normal Spetsnaz, and you're that much more likely to
        get seriously hurt. Keep your eyes open."

---

Sigint: "Heads up, Snake. Looks like some of those guys are equipped with 
        M63s. The M63 is an American-made light machine gun. It's got more
        firepower than you might think. It can punch through a wall too so
        watch out."

---

Sigint: "You said some of them were using shotguns? Those shotguns are M37s.
        They're an American model designed for field combat. Not all that
        dangerous from a distance, but at close range, they'll tear you to
        shreds. Be careful."

---

Sigint: "Looks like some of them are using Scorpions. The Scorpion is a
        Czechoslovakian submachine gun. They don't have the stopping power of
        a rifle, but they're easier to handle, and lethal at a medium range.
        If you eat more than a couple of rounds it's not gonna be pretty. Don't
        fool around."

---

Sigint: "Snake, watch out for those grenades they're tossin'. You'll be
        injured pretty bad if you get caught in the blast. You could get
        burned, too. If somebody throws a grenade at you, get away from it
        and hit the deck."

---

Sigint: "Snake, if you fire that thing without a suppressor attached, the bang
        and the muzzle flash will give your position away to the enemy. Attach
        a suppressor and you won't have to worry about all that. To attach a
        suppressor, open the Weapon Window and press the Enter Button."

---

Sigint: "Snake, they're usin' stun grenades - watch out!"
Snake: "Stun grenades?"
Sigint: "Yeah. It's a new weapon they've invented themselves. It uses an
        intense blast of light and sound to knock the enemy out temporarily.
        If you're lookin' at the light from one of those things when it goes
        off, you can kiss your optics goodbye. If one gets tossed your way,
        turn around quick."

13) Rassvet, post-Ocelot fight
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "It looks like you got rid of all the Ocelots."
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "Now, proceed with the rescue of Sokolov. According to EVA, you
            should start by going to the crevice to the north and..."
Snake: "Can we trust her?"
Major Zero: "What's that?"
Snake: "EVA is with the KGB, isn't she? Can I really believe what she says?
       How do I know she won't double cross me?"
Major Zero: "There are no guarantees in espionage, Snake. Only calculated
            guesses. At this point in time, the KGB stands nothing to gain
            by stabbing us in the back."
Snake: "So you're saying I can trust her?"
Major Zero: "I'm saying the chance that she'll betray you is low."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "Of course, we checked the route she gave you against our data.
            It looked like a pretty solid infiltration route. It makes good
            use of weak spots in the enemy's defense. You shouldn't have any
            problems. Follow the route EVA showed you and proceed with the
            mission."
Snake: "Roger."
Major Zero: "First, enter the cave through the crevice. EVA said it was to
            the north. So head that way."

Major Zero: "First, enter the cave through the crevasse. EVA said it was to the
            north. So head that way."

Para-Medic: "I see you've got yourself a ration. Rations are portable meals
            carried by Soviet soldiers. I've heard some nasty stories about
            how they taste. It looks like the rumors are true."
Snake: "Great..."
Para-Medic: "Hey, you should be grateful. Those things are designed to last. No
            matter how long you keep a ration, it'll never go bad. And they're
            surprisingly good for you, too. "
Snake: "I'd take a snake over this any day, even if it is a little rotten..."
Para-Medic: "You are hopeless..."

Sigint: "Hey Snake, remember back at the abandoned factory when you whittled
        the grip of that .45 down?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Sigint: "I've never heard of a customization like that before. Why the grip?"
Snake: "To fit with the knife."
Sigint: "A knife? You're gonna keep the knife and the gun both at the ready?"
Snake: "That's the idea."
Sigint: "Why would you want to do that?"
Snake: "Sometimes a knife works better in close proximity encounters. So I
       equip both at the same time. That way I can instantly switch back and
       forth in an instant."
Sigint: "Bad ass... So that's that..."
Snake: "...CQC."

---

Sigint: "Snake, you said EVA said her Mauser was a Type 17, right?"
Snake: "Yeah. What about it?"
Sigint: "That model was produced in the 1920's in a weapons lab in the Shanxi
        Province in China. The cartridge part sticks out lower than the
        original to accommodate .45 caliber rounds. The barrel and chamber are
        a little bit thicker, too. But most of all, it's got Chinese characters
        engraved on both sides of the frame, like you saw. And that firing
        stance EVA was talking about where you hold the gun horizontally -
        that's a trademark of the Chinese. Just like you were saying, when
        you're firing in full-auto mode, the muzzle-jump effect gives you a
        horizontal strafing motion. They say it's especially deadly in indoor
        and close range mop-up actions. The Japanese call it 'Bandit Shooting'
        and used to dread it. Makes you wonder where she learned to shoot like
        that."

---

Sigint: "You know that army motorcycle that EVA was riding? That's a replica of
        a German model."
Snake: "A replica?"
Sigint: "Yeah. After World War II, the Soviets confiscated an entire assembly
        line from a German motorcycle factory - machines and all."
Snake: "And then they took it back with them and started producing replicas?"
Sigint: "Exactly. Originally, that motorcycle was designed to be used with a
        sidecar attached. That means it's got enough power to drag a 200-plus
        pound sidecar around."
Snake: "So that's how she could pull off all those crazy stunts."
Sigint: "Mm-hmm. Of course, it takes a lot of skill to be able to control that
        much power. That EVA chick is something else."

---

Sigint: "So you've got an M1911A1, huh?"
Snake: "Yeah. EVA gave it to me. She said it used to belong to a Western
       officer."
Sigint: "Looks like someone did a little work on it, too."
Snake: "It's more than a little. First of all, the feeding ramp has been
       polished to a mirror sheen. It's not going to have any feeding problems.
       The slide's been replaced with a reinforced version. And it meshes
       perfectly with the frame. The frame itself has been iron-welded and
       scraped down multiple times for maximum precision. The front strap part
       of the frame has been checkered to make it dig into the hand. That 
       prevents any slipping. The sight system's original, too. It's a 3-dot
       type. It's got an enlarged front sight, giving it superior target
       sighting capability. The regular hammer's been replaced with a ring
       hammer. That enhances the cocking speed and increases the hammer-down
       speed. They also reworked the grip safety to accommodate the ring
       hammer. Looks like they eliminated it altogether. This is a tool for
       pros. The thumbs safety and the slide stop are extended to allow for
       more precise handling. The base of the trigger guard is whittled down,
       so you can use a high grip. And the trigger itself is a long type for
       easy finger access. The trigger pull is about 3.5 pounds. That's about
       a pound and a half lighter than normal. The magazine well has been
       widened to make it easier to put in a new magazine. The magazine catch
       button has been cut down low to make it harder to hit by mistake. The
       mainspring housing has been changed to a flat type to increase grip. And
       it's even been fitted with stepping so that it doesn't slip from the
       recoil when firing. On top of that, they added cocking serrations to the
       front part of the slide. That lets you load and eject cartridges faster
       in an emergency. Whoever did this is a professional. No question - this
       thing could shoot a one-hole at 25 yards in a machine rest."
Sigint: "Well, I'll be damned. That's some gun."
Snake: "Yeah. I've never used a weapon this fine in my life."

---

Sigint: "The Mk22 is a tranquilizer gun. You can use it to take enemies down
        without hurting them. The thing is, the amount of time it takes for the
        tranquilizer to work depends on which part of the body the dart hits. 
        If you need to drop an enemy in one shot, aim for the head. The Mk22
        can also be equipped with a suppressor. With a suppressor equipped, you
        won't need to worry about anybody hearing the shot. But, the suppressor
        will deteriorate each time the gun is fired. The durability of your
        suppressor is displayed on the weapon icon whenever the suppressor is
        equipped. Be sure to keep an eye on it. A suppressor can be unequipped
        by pressing the Enter Button while the Weapon Window is open. It's a
        good idea to take the suppressor off a gun when you don't need it."

Major Zero: "Snake, I see you're in the water. The controls when you're
            underwater are quite different from when you're on land. The
            left analog stick controls the direction you're facing. Press up,
            down, left, or right to turn in that direction. Press the CQC
            Button or the Crawl Button to move forward. Each button press will

            faster. You can also press the Action Button to surface in an
            emergency. While you're swimming, you can use the right analog
            stick to look in a different direction without changing the 
            direction you're going."

Major Zero: "That swamp is pretty deep. It's probably deep enough to dive
            underwater and swim around. Press the Crawl Button when you're
            swimming on the surface to dive underwater. The controls when
            you're underwater are quit different from when you're on land. The

Major Zero: "Snake, you'll be helpless if a crocodile attacks you in the water.
            You can't see behind you when you're swimming. So if you're in a
            crocodile-infested swamp, keep an eye on your six. Also, by using
            your sensors, you should be able to detect crocodiles before they
            get too close."

Major Zero: "EVA was right when she said that operating in an unknown jungle
            at night is extremely dangerous. In my former outfit, the SAS, we'd
            always be sure to set up camp before sunset and wait until daybreak
            before setting out again. Being able to stay in that abandoned
            factory made things a lot easier for you. You ought to be thanking
            EVA."

Snake: "Major, what's this temptation EVA was talking about?"
Major Zero: "In the Old Testament of the Bible, Eve was seduced by a snake into
            tasting the fruit of knowledge. By eating the forbidden fruit, Adam
            and Eve disobeyed God's command and were cast out from the Garden
            of Eden. Thus, it was the snake who led mankind into original sin.
Snake: "Come to think of it, I did break a rib in the Virtuous Mission. Maybe
       that's where EVA came from."
Major Zero: "But the one who tempted Adam into eating the forbidden fruit was
            Eve. You may be working together, but she's still a KGB operative.
            Don't let your guard down."
Snake: "I don't intend to."

Major Zero: "Snake, your number one priority in this mission is rescuing
            Sokolov. EVA said he is in the lab, so head over there."
Snake: "Right."
Major Zero: "Do you remember how to get to the lab?"
Snake: "You mean what EVA told me?"
Major Zero: "Yes."
Snake: "Of course I do."
Major Zero: "Alright, repeat it for me."
Snake: "Major, do you think I'd forget something like that?"
Major Zero: "Let's hear it then."
Snake: "First, I head north."
Major Zero: "Mmm."
Snake: "Then I'll come to a crevice..."
Major Zero: "And then?"
Snake: "And then..."
Major Zero: "... All right, let's go over this one more time. First, head north
            through the jungle. Enter the cave through the crevice to the
            north. Follow the cave to the end and you'll come out in an 
            aqueduct surrounded by mangrove. Follow the aqueduct to the north
            and you should arrive at a warehouse. Climb out of the water and 
            enter the warehouse. After you've infiltrated the warehouse, pass
            though it to the north. Then you'll emerge in the wood again. The
            lab will be directly to the north. And we clear now?"
Snake: "Y-yeah."
Major Zero: "Snake..."
Snake: "I got it, I got it. Basically I just head north, right?"
Major Zero: "..."

Major Zero: "Snake, I heard you got a scientist disguise from EVA."
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "Go to 'UNIFORM' on the 'CAMOUFLAGE' screen and choose 'SCIENTIST'
            to disguise yourself as a scientist."
Snake: "'SCIENTIST', huh."
Major Zero: "But it won't do you any good to go around the jungle wearing a
            scientist disguise."
Para-Medic: "No one would be that stupid."
Major Zero: "You're right. No one would think of going around the jungle in a
            scientist disguise. If they did, they'd have to be a fool. No, more
            than a fool -- a complete dumbass. Don't you think so, Snake?"
Snake: "Yeah..."

Major Zero: "Snake, what in God's name..."
Snake: "How does it look?"
Para-Medic: "It looks cool!"
Snake: "Huh?"
Para-Medic: "It looks cool on you."
Snake: "It does?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah!"
Snake: "I don't think 'cool' is the right word."
Para-Medic: "Why? What's wrong with it?"
Snake: "What's wrong... Don't you think it looks silly? Doesn't it make you
       laugh? Aren't you going to ask me what the hell I was thinking?"
Para-Medic: "No."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "I think it really does look good. It reminds me of 'The Alligator
            People.'"
Snake: "Oh...the what?"
Para-Medic: "'The Alligator People.' It's a science fiction movie. You've never
            heard of it?"
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "Oh...well, you should see it sometime. It's about this guy who 
            gets hurt in a car accident and tries to heal his wounds by 
            injecting himself with a crocodile serum, but his head turns into
            a crocodile head. You look just like him with that mask on. That's
            awesome."
Snake: "Right..."
Para-Medic: "???"
Major Zero: "Ah, never mind. I suppose you might be able to disguise yourself
            as a crocodile by wearing that cap and sticking your head out of
            the water."

---

Major Zero: "Snake..."
Snake: "What's wrong, Major?"
Major Zero: "I should be asking you the same question. Why are you wearing
            that outfit?"
Snake: "Wanted to try it on."
Major Zero: "Did you listen to a word that I said? What are you thinking,
            dressing like a scientist in the middle of the jungle? Look
            at your Camo Index. You're a walking bull's-eye. Get back into
            your camouflage, now!
Snake: "...lighten up..."
Major Zero: "What was that!?"
Snake: "Nothing."

Para-Medic: "I see you've caught an arowana. The arowana is an ancient fish
            that lives in tropical freshwater areas. Because of its large
            size, I don't think you'll be able to capture one alive. Ancient
            fish like the arowana are living fossils. They've hardly changed
            their forms since the Devonian and Jurassic periods. Other ancient
            fish besides the arowana include the coelacanth, the startlet, and
            the knifefish. Almost all organisms on earth have evolved in 
            various shapes and forms, but these fish have kept the same form
            for hundreds of millions of years. Baffling, isn't it?"
Snake: "Sure."
Para-Medic: "Well, I can see you're not interested."
Snake: "Not all all. I'm fascinated by ancient fish."
Para-Medic: "Why?"
Snake: "They're supposed to be huge, aren't they?"
Para-Medic: "You're wondering whether they'd make a good meal."
Snake: "Yeah. So? Do they?"
Para-Medic: "The guide says they taste just fine for a fish."
Snake: "Great!"

Para-Medic: "Snake, look at your body."
Snake: "Yep, looking good."
Para-Medic: "Not there!"
Snake: "Then where?"
Para-Medic: "See the leeches?"
Snake: "Leeches?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. You've got leeches all over you."
Snake: "Leeches will sometimes attach themselves to you if you spend a long
       time in the water or the swamp. When you've got leeches on you, they'll
       suck your blood, causing you to lose stamina. You should get rid of them
       as soon as possible. To get rid of leeches, go into 'CURE' in the
       Survival Viewer and press your cigar into them. Or, if you use the
       insecticidal bug juice ahead of time, the leeches won't bother you as
       long as the bug juice is in effect."

Para-Medic: "By the way, Snake..."
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "You know the Ocelot Unit commander?"
Snake: "Ocelot?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. That's not his real name, is it?"
Snake: "I wouldn't think so."
Para-Medic: "Is it a code name?"
Snake: "You mean like Snake?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah."
Snake: "Maybe...why, is that strange?"
Para-Medic: "No, I was just wondering why he's called Ocelot."
Snake: "Why's that?"
Para-Medic: "Well, I looked it up and it turns out the ocelot is a wild cat
            whose habitat stretches from the southern U.S. down to northern
            Argentina. They live in a variety of different environments, from
            tropical rain forest to savannas. The biggest ones can grow up to
            one meter in length. They're normally solitary creatures, and their
            diet consists mainly of small animals and fish. During the day they
            sleep up in the trees, but at night..."
Snake: "Para-Medic..."
Para-Medic: "Oh, right. So the ocelot is an animal that lives on the American
            continent. But then I wondered - why would a Soviet officer be 
            using the name of an American wildcat?"
Snake: "...Good question. Maybe it's because he's fast and agile like an 
       ocelot?"
Para-Medic: "Hmm. Yeah, maybe you're right."
Snake: "Mmm. But why'd you go to all the trouble of looking it up?"
Para-Medic: "Because I was curious. Was it helpful?"
Snake: "...Uh, sure."

Para-Medic: "Snake, be careful, that area is inhabited by coral snakes. The
            coral snake is a venomous snake that originally hails from the
            Americas. Its venom is a very potent neurotoxin, so don't let it
            bite you. If you do get bitten, go into the Survival Viewer right
            away and use 'CURE' to neutralize the poison with a serum
            injection. The colorful red and black patterns on the coral snake
            are a warning sign. Apparently, the bright, flashy colors and
            pattern let other animals know that it carries a deadly poison.
            That keeps them from attacking. There are many animals that mimic
            the colors of known poisonous animals as a defense. See, by
            mimicking other poisonous creatures, they increase their own
            chances of survival. There is another non-poisonous snake called
            the milk snake that borrows its coloring from the coral snake."
Snake: "Uh huh..."
Para-Medic: "You're not even listening, are you?"
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "..."

Para-Medic: "When you get shot with an arrow, your maximum LIFE will go down
            depending on how bad it is, so watch out. You can let the wound
            heal naturally, or you can treat it using 'CURE' in the Survival
            Viewer to make it heal right away. To treat an arrow ound, first
            use your knife to dig the arrow out. Then disinfect the wound and
            apply styptic to stop the flow of blood. Once that's all done, the
            arrow wound should heal right up."

---

Para-Medic: "That area is inhabited by the milk snake. The milk snake closely
            resembles the coral snake, but it's actually not venomous. Even so,
            you'll still take damage if it bites you, so don't get too close."
Snake: "Hmm. So is there a way to tell the difference between a milk snake and
       a coral snake?"
Para-Medic: "It's pretty difficult. They really do look almost exactly alike. I
            guess if I had to pick something, I'd say that the milk snake is
            much less aggressive."
Snake: "OK..."
Para-Medic: "Ah, I just thought of a better way. You're going to love this."
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "Eat it."
Snake: "Eat it?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. The guide says milk snakes don't taste very good."
Snake: "Yeah, I know. But if I've caught and eaten it, what does it matter 
       which kind of snake it was?"
Para-Medic: "...It doesn't, does it? Shoot, I thought I had a good idea..."
Snake: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is inhabited by the poison dart frog. The poison
            dart frog is native to the tropical rain forests of Central and
            South America. They normally grow between two and five centimeters
            in length, but for some reason the ones in that area seem to be
            much bigger than that. Poison dart frogs are known to carry a 
            potent neurotoxin called pumiliotoxin. Long ago, people used the
            poison to coat their arrows for hunting. Watch out because if you
            eat one, you'll get food poisoning.

Sigint: "A cap shaped like a crocodile head, you say?"
Snake: "Yeah, what do you think?"
Sigint: "I think it's a great idea! You know, animal disguises are one of the
        oldest tricks in the book in the intelligence world. I don't know 
        whether it's true or not, but I've heard that during World War II, the
        OSS used to use cow suits. Supposedly they'd send agents out to hide in
        herds of real cows so they could spy on enemy units as they passed by.
        Nowadays, I guess most people wouldn't even give a crocodile-shaped cap
        a second look. They'd think it was just a gag item. But if you use it
        the right way, it can be an effective weapon for spying. I gotta hand
        it to you, Snake, you're one sharp guy."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "You OK, snake?"
Snake: "Forget it..."
Sigint: "???"

Sigint: "Snake, what is that stuff you're wearing?"
Snake: "I dunno. It's called GA-KO camo, whatever that means..."
Para-Medic: "What!?"
Sigint: "Para-Medic...?"
Para-Medic: "You've never heard of GA-KO?"
Snake: "Nope."
Sigint: "Never."
Para-Medic: "You must live in a cave or something..."
Sigint: "Well, excuse me. By the way, Snake, that outfit is really killing your
        Camo Index. Unless you want the enemy to see you, I'd suggest you 
        change your clothes as..."
Para-Medic: "Why?"
Sigint: "Why? Because his Camo Index is..."
Para-Medic: "Camo Index, shamamo Index."
Sigint: "Hold on now..."
Para-Medic: "He's wearing a GA-KO suit."
Sigint: "Why?"
Para-Medic: "Because it looks cute."
Sigint: "Snake, talk some sense into her!"
Snake: "What's wrong with being cute?"
Sigint: "...am I the only normal person around here...?"

Sigint: "So you're wearing the scientist uniform. Wearing that scientist outfit
        lets you pose as a scientist. But be forewarned - you can't equip most
        of your weapons while you're disguised as a scientist. Even when you're
        disguised, your cover will be blown if you get blood on your clothes or
        something. If you do get blood on your clothes, take them off and 
        switch to another outfit. The blood stain should come out after a 
        little while."

EVA: "That area is known as Chyornyj Prud. The names means something like 'the
     black shore' in Russian. It got its name from the deep swamp that covers
     the area. The crocodiles in that swamp are extremely vicious. Apparently,
     they've already chewed up a bunch of soldiers out on patrol. Now no one
     even dares to go near the swamp. They said that most of the soldiers who
     were killed were attacked from behind while they were in the water. You be
     careful out there."

Snake: "EVA, what kind of unit are those Ocelots I fought a little while ago?"
EVA: "The Ocelot unit is an elite group composed of soldiers hand-picked from
     among the ranks of Spetsnaz, the special forces wing of GRU. They've
     undergone even more rigorous training than regular Spetsnaz. Their skill
     with weapons is the stuff of legends. You'll find they're much better
     shots than the rest of GRU. Watch yourself."

EVA: "The crevice that leads to the cave is still a ways to the north. Keep
     heading that way."

Snake: "EVA, where are you now?"
EVA: "I told you, didn't I? I'm right near the colonel."
Snake: "Pretty weak answer if you ask me."
EVA: "I suppose you're right."
Snake: "EVA..."
EVA: "Snake, I'm under orders to cooperate with you, but that doesn't mean I
     have to tell you everything I know. I would assume the same applies to 
     you, too."
Snake: "..."

---

EVA: "Tell me something, Snake. Why did you let Ocelot get away?"
Snake: "I thought I told you already."
EVA: "Because he's still a kid?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "Pretty lame excuse if you ask me."
Snake: "You think so?"
EVA: "Yeah, I do."
Snake: "...Maybe you're right."

EVA: "Snake, have you heard about the massacre that happened in the forest near
     the village of Gnezdovo?"
Snake: "The Katyn Forest Massacre, right?"
EVA: "During WWII, the German army came upon the bodies of 4,000 dead Polish in
     the forest of Katyn. Germany blamed the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union
     denied it, blaming Germany in return. The truth is that Stalin ordered the
     NKVD to carry out the killings. And it's not just Katyn. In places like
     Western Ukraine and Belarus, there must have been at least 20,000 Poles in
     the prison camps."
Snake: "Why are you telling me this?"
EVA: "Volgin was one of the people responsible. He was one of the vicious
     leaders behind it."
Snake: "Volgin was?"
EVA: "He blamed it on a prisoner revolt to allay any fears, and requested that
     they be put to death. I've heard that Volgin even removed the blindfolds
     from each prisoner before he beat them to death."
Snake: "I knew he wasn't all there in the head, but this..."
EVA: "Not someone you could be friends with."

EVA: "Snake?"
Snake: "EVA, what do you think?"
EVA: "What a dork! You must be kidding me! Are you willing to risk your life
     for that joke?"
Snake: "All right! Finally, I get a normal response..."
EVA: "???"
Snake: "Everyone was giving me strange responses and acting like nothing was
       odd about it. I was starting to wonder myself, but now I feel better."
EVA: "I'm not sure what you're talking about, but you look adorable in it.

EVA: "By the way Snake, do you have a Calorie Mate?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "Is it any good?"
Snake: "I haven't tried it yet."
EVA: "Oh..."
Snake: "You want it?"
EVA: "What?"
Snake: "Do you want the Calorie Mate?"
EVA: "Wha--, What are you saying?"
Snake: "You want it don't you..."
EVA: "I didn't say that."
Snake: "So you don't want it then."
EVA: "No... ...but...if you were going to give it to me as a token of thanks
     for me helping you out, then of course I wouldn't refuse it."
Snake: "Are you on a diet?"
EVA: "What did you say?"
Snake: "Calorie Mate is supposed to be really good for losing weight."
EVA: "Are you saying I'm fat?"
Snake: "No..."
EVA: "I'm not on a diet, and I don't need one. I just wanted to try the taste."
Snake: "Oh, sorry."
EVA: "Be careful with what you say."
Snake: "Yeah, sorry."
EVA: "...so, is it true?"
Snake: "Is what true?"
EVA: "That it's good for losing weight."
Snake: "...yeah. Calorie Mate provides a nutritionally balanced source of
       energy and it makes counting calories easy. That's what's supposed to
       make it good for dieting."
EVA: "Ah, I see..."
Snake: "I heard all the geisha in Japan use it."
EVA: "Geisha?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "I've never heard about that."
Snake: "Really?"
EVA: "Yes. I'm sure there are some geisha out there using Calorie Mate for
      diets, but I doubt all of them are using it."
Snake: "I guess not..."

Snake: "EVA, that was some pretty nice driving."
EVA: "Really?"
Snake: "Ballsy but overwhelmingly accurate. That kind of driving isn't 
       something you pick up in a couple days."
EVA: "I told you to trust me. I love motorcycles."
Snake: "It is not easy to jack-knife a bike like that."
EVA: "So, you believe me now?"
Snake: "Think I'll pass on going tandem though."
EVA: "That's too bad."

Snake: "EVA, about the .45 and the Mk22 you showed me..."
EVA: "Yeah?"
Snake: "You said you got them from a vault full of Western weapons, right?"
EVA: "That I did."
Snake: "How? A vault of secret Western technology should be under strict
       surveillance."
EVA: "You really want to know?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "Really?"
Snake: "Yes."
EVA: "Well, I'm not telling anyway."
Snake: "Why not?"
EVA: "It'd be a waste of time."
Snake: "A waste of time?"
EVA: "Even if I explained how I did it, you'd never be able to do it yourself."
Snake: "What does that mean?"
EVA: "Exactly what it sounds like."

Snake: "EVA."
EVA: "Hmm?"
Snake: "You said you got along with The Boss, right?"
EVA: "Yeah, we get along pretty well. I admire her. Although she's supposed to
     be the distant hero, for some reason she's nice to me. She even carried my
     bags for me the other day. I was impressed."
Snake: "Your bags?"
EVA: "Maybe because we're both defectors. We never talk much, but I get the
     feeling that she understands how I feel. I've had dreams about the whole
     thing."

EVA: "Snake, be careful. I might not have told you this yet, but that swamp is
     rigged with traps."
Snake: "Tell me about it."
EVA: "So you know already?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "Well, then you're all set. The traps in that area are set to go off when
     a rope stretched across the ground is disturbed. Keep a close eye on the
     ground and make sure you don't trip over a rope. I mean, far be it for me
     to call you an idiot who can't avoid even the simplest of traps. But you
     know."
Snake: "Rrgh..."
EVA: "What's the matter?"
Snake: "Nothing...never mind..."
EVA: "???"

Major Zero: "Snake, be careful. That barbed wire is electrified, and you'll get
            a shock if you touch it."
Snake: "It looks like there's no other way to get over it."
Major Zero: "Didn't EVA say that the barbed wire doesn't receive proper
            maintenance? Look carefully at the bottom of the barbed wire. There
            might be a gap somewhere. If you find an opening, crawl through it
            flat on the ground."

---

Major Zero: "That area is reportedly planted with Claymore mines. Claymores
            pack quite a punch. Don't risk heavy injury. Be careful. Claymores
            are not completely buried in the ground. If you look closely 
            enough, you can tell where they've been hidden. You can also pick
            Claymores up by crawling over them. It'll be useful if you recover
            a few of the enemy's traps."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, it loks like they've got attack dogs in that area.
            Attack dogs generally receive extensive military training
            in tracking and combat techniques. They're formidable close-
            -range fighters, and difficult to elude. Their barking can
            alert enemy patrols to your presence as well. Take care not
            to let attack dogs catch sight of you. Attack dogs may be
            dangerous, but they can't climb trees. If you've been cornered
            by attack dogs, try climbing a tree. Smoke grenades should 
            prove useful as well.

---

Para-Medic: "You say there are attack dogs? Those attack dogs are Great
            Danes. The breed is originally from Germany. They've been used
            for hundreds of years as hunting dogs. As you can see, they're
            very large. Strong, too. They've got a calm yet courageous
            temperament. And on top of that, they're extremely intelligent.
            In some cases, a trained Great Dane can be more dangerous than
            a human opponent. Watch out for them."
Snake: "Interesting."
Para-Medic: "Forget it, Snake!!"
Snake: "Forget what?"
Para-Medic: "You were thinking about how they taste, weren't you?"
Snake: "I wasn't thinking..."
Para-Medic: "Don't lie to me. I can tell by the look on your face."
Snake: "You can't see my face."
Para-Medic: "No, but I can imagine it!"
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "Don't you dare think about trying to capture an attack dog."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "You hear me!?"
Snake: "Yeah, yeah..."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, be careful of those attack dogs."
Snake: "Don't worry. I know how dangerous they are."
Para-Medic: "No, you're the one who's dangerous."
Snake: "Me?"
Para-Medic: "Those dogs are just innocent animals, even if they've been
            trained to kill. You shouldn't hurt them unless you have to."
Snake: "But..."
Para-Medic: "You know, humans and dogs have been living together for 50,000
            years, ever since the Stone Age. Sure, they make great pets and
            watch dogs... But they also help us out in a variety of different
            fields - not just as police and army dogs, but as hunters,
            shepherds, rescuers, and seeing-eye dogs. They deserve our
            respect."
Snake: "I know what you mean. I'm a dog-sled fan, myself."
Para-Medic: "In the future, many of the jobs that dogs do now will probably
            be taken over by machines. They'll have miniature unmanned
            reconnaissance vehicle and security systems... And in the 21st
            century, I bet they'll even be selling robot dogs as pets."
Snake: "You've got to be kidding."
Para-Medic: "But even if that happens, dogs will still be our most trusted
            companions."
Snake: "Unmanned recon vehicle...that's a pretty scary thought."
Para-Medic: "Well, for now, trained dogs are the best they've got."

Sigint: "They sicced attack dogs on you? People have been using dogs in war
        since before recorded history. The Greek and Roman armies used to send
        out packs of dogs with spiked collars to charge at enemy ranks. Attack
        dogs were regularly employed in the First and Second World Wars as 
        well. Traditionally, dogs have been used to keep watch, send messages,
        and assist in search operations. Then the Soviets came up with a new
        idea: using them to carry bombs."
Snake: "Bomb dogs?"
Sigint: "Yeah, they were trained to dive beneath tanks, carrying a payload of
        bombs. Apparently it worked pretty well, but the Russians messed up,
        man - they used their own tanks for the training. Turns out the dogs
        kept going after Russian tanks and blowing them up. So, the plan was
        scrapped before it got off the ground. Well, I don't think you need to
        worry about those dogs exploding on you. They don't seem to be the
        bomb-carrying type. But they are highly trained in tracking and
        detection. Don't underestimate them - they're excellent trackers and
        ferocious fighters. Attack dogs move fast and are deadly in proximity
        encounters. They'll pick up your scent and use it to track you, so 
        it'll be hard to shake them off. In a way, they're more dangerous than
        any human opponent. Be prepared. The Soviet-made smoke grenades you
        might find around there also seem to act as a mild tear gas. It might
        not have that much of an effect on human targets wearing balaclavas,
        but it ought to wreak havoc on a dog's nose. If you're being chased 
        by attack dogs, give 'em a taste of the smoke grenade."

---

Sigint: "Looks like you're wearing the splitter pattern camo. Splitter was
        used quite a bit in World War II on German aircraft and stuff. The
        pattern helped mask the plane's attitude [sic] and direction in
        dogfights. Even now, it's still being used as camouflage in some
        places. It works best when you wear it against a steel or stone
        background."

---

Sigint: "Snake, it looks like there are Claymore mines planted all over that
        area. Claymores are a new type of anti-personnel mine produced in
        America. The ones you see there must have either been stolen or
        recovered from a battlefield in Southeast Asia. And what's more, our
        Russian friends seem to have modified these Claymores with a special
        type of sensor. If you get anywhere near them, BANG! - you're
        toast... Watch your step. Claymores can be picked up by crawling over
        them. If you come across a minefield, try crawling through it."

---

Sigint: "Ah, you got yourself some Claymores. The M18A1 Claymore is a new type
        of anti-personnel directional mine developed in the U.S. after the
        Korean War. The gently curved casing is packed with a pound and a half
        of high-grade explosives. The side facing the enemy is lined with 700
        steel ball bearings. So when the mine explodes, the ball bearings 
        burst out of the casing. Anyone in the kill zone, be he friend or foe,
        is instant Swiss cheese. The mine is triggered by an electric 
        detonator. Apparently, the detonator's got some kind of special motion
        detector built in. Yeah. When the mine is planted, it reacts to 
        anything that comes close and automatically explodes. Just make sure
        you don't trip your own mine or something stupid like that."
Snake: "I'll be careful."
Sigint: "You can pick up a planted Claymore by crawling over it. Mines 
        planted by the enemy can also be picked up in this way, so if you
        come across a minefield, it's a good idea to crawl through and pick
        up the mines."
Snake: "What are they doing making minefields out of Western mines, anyway?"
Sigint: "They're probably doing field performance evaluations on mines they
        either captured or stole from the West. The structure of the Claymore
        isn't actually all that complicated. They must be learning a lot about
        them. It might not be long before we start seeing 'Claymorasky' mines."

---

Sigint: "Gonna use a grenade huh? That's the RGD-5, the standard blast-
        -fragmentation grenade of the Soviet army. The grenade itself is
        composed of two steel-plated casings. Each of those casings has an
        inner fragment liner that causes it to burst into over 300 shards when
        the grenade explodes. The grenade will deliver heavy damage to any
        enemies within its blast area. The safety pin is on the opposite side
        relative to the M26, so be sure to hold the safety lever down with
        your finger when you grip it. The safety is released when you actually
        throw the grenade, and it'll explode three seconds later."
Snake: "So what you're saying is, it won't explode in my hand while I'm holding
       it?"
Sigint: "Of course not!"
Snake: "Oh..."
Sigint: "To throw a grenade, press and release the Weapon Button. Remember that
        how far you throw it depends on how hard it's pressed. Press lightly if
        you want to drop it close to you, and press harder if you want to lob
        it away. It'll probably be easier to control your throw if you do it in
        First Person View."

EVA: "Snake, the barbed wire in that area has a high-voltage electric current
     running through it."
Snake: "A high-voltage electric current?"
EVA: "Right, thought I must have forgotten to tell you."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "You'll get electrocuted if you touch that barbed wire. So don't."
Snake: "Electrified barbed wire, huh. Looks like I'll have to find another way
       around..."
EVA: "That won't be necessary."
Snake: "It won't?"
EVA: "Nope. Electrified barbed wire is a formidable barrier, but it's a pain
     in the neck to maintain. Apparently it's always breaking down because wild
     animals keep running into it. But the word is they don't have enough
     personnel to fix it. If you look closely at the bottom of the barbed wire,
     you should be able to spot a hole somewhere. Try crawling your way through
     there."

---

EVA: "Good, you made it to Bolshaya Past. The name Bolshaya Past means 
     something close to 'the great cavity.' It probably got that name from the
     crevice to the north. There's a fortified area in the southern part of
     Bolshaya Past that's strung with barbed wire. To the north of that is a
     relay station that serves as both a depot for material shipments and a
     communications facility. The crevice leading to the cave is located to
     the north of the relay station. Head north."

---

EVA: "The crevice that leads to the cave is to the north of your current
     location. Keep heading north."

---

EVA: "Snake, sorry if I forgot to tell you, but they've got attack dogs
     prowling around that area. If they find you, you'll be in for a rough
     time. Attack dogs are trained for fighting, and you won't be able to
     shake them off so easily. If they bark at you, it'll alert nearby
     patrols to your presence. Be careful not to get spotted by those dogs."

Major Zero: "Good, you've reached the relay station. But stay alert. That
            station is an enemy strong point. The security is bound to be
            tight."
Snake: "But there's no other way to make it to the crevice if I don't make it
       through."
Major Zero: "Exactly. The crevice leading to the cave is in the north of that
            area. Find a way to slip past the enemy and head north."

Sigint: "Wearing the water pattern, are we? The water pattern was used a lot
        by the old German Defense Force. Even though it's called the water
        pattern, it wasn't designed specifically to blend in underwater. They
        only gave it that name because the pattern resembles the waves on the
        surface of a pool of water. But still, it really does look like it
        could be confused for liquid waves. It might conceal you underwater."

Sigint: "You say you're using a magazine? A magazine is what's left when you
        empty the clip of a gun. But what do you plan to do with it?"
Snake: "I'm going to throw it."
Sigint: "Throw it?"
Snake: "Yeah. The sound it makes when it hits the ground will distract the
       enemy's attention."
Sigint: "Ah...a diversion! Guess state-of-the-art weapons aren't the only
        things that determine victory or defeat."

Sigint: "Looks like you've got some TNT. TNT is short for trinitrotoluene, a
        pale yellow crystalline compound made from a tri-nitrified mix of
        nitric acid and sulfuric acid. It's used throughout the world as a
        military explosive. It has a low sensitivity and is chemically stable,
        making it easy to handle. It's also got a low melting point, and can
        easily be shaped by boiling or steaming it. But because the sensitivity
        is so low, you need a booster to actually get it to explode."
Snake: "No problem. It came with its own remote control detonator."
Sigint: "Good. Then all you have to do is press the Weapon Button to place the
        TNT and then press the CQC Button to set it off. The 'MAP' screen in
        the Survival Viewer will display the locations where you've planted
        TNT. Take warning though - the radio signal for the detonator is pretty
        weak. Don't forget that pressing the CQC Button will only set off the
        TNT that's planted in the same area."

Sigint: "Hey, you got a mousetrap! That mousetrap is a portable tool for
        capturing small animals alive. Press the Weapon Button to place it on
        the ground. Come back a little later, and there might be a frog or a
        snake caught in there. Whether or not you actually catch anything,
        though, is all a matter of luck. Don't get all down if there's nothing
        in the trap. Try, try again. Also, don't forget that you need some bait
        in the trap or nothing's gonna come crawling in there. If you capture
        an animal with a trap, it won't have any bait left. Just crawl to pick
        it up. Then put some more bait back in and set it down again. You can
        use the 'MAP' in the Survival Viewer to see where you've placed traps.
        If you forget where you put a trap, just look at the 'MAP'."

Snake: "Sigint."
Sigint: "What's up?"
Snake: "The chopper we were talking about is parked at the heliport."
Sigint: "The one that was hauling the Shagohod in the Virtuous Mission?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "Perhaps it's an armed variation of the Mi-8 Hip?"
Snake: "No. Some of it looks the same, but the overall shape is different. 
       It's got stub wings, and the cockpit canopy looks like an angular
       greenhouse."
Sigint: "No kidding. Then it must be some kind of new model. I've heard
        stories recently that the Soviets are developing a 'flying infantry
        combat vehicle.' That's got to be it."
Snake: "A flying infantry combat vehicle?"
Sigint: "Yeah. A transport chopper with troop carrying capabilities. Think of
        it as a attack-chopper version of France's AMX-VCI or the Soviet BMP.
        They must be doing field tests on the initial prototype."
Snake: "A next-generation chopper that's a little smaller than the Hip...
       Maybe we should call it a Hind."
Sigint: "Hmm, not bad. It's cool with me."
Major Zero: "Then it's settled. We'll refer to that new-type helicopter as a
            Hind from now on."

     heading north."

===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, are you OK? Snake!!"
Snake: "Major..."
Major Zero: "Snake..."
Para-Medic: "Are you all right? You're not hurt?"
Snake: "No. That was a hell of a drop, but I'm fine. ...Looks like there's no
       way back up though."
Major Zero: "I see... Well, anyway, it's good to hear you're not injured.
            Slipping and falling may not have been part of the plan, but 
            getting into that cave was. Proceed further into the cave. The cave
            seems to be structured like a maze, but there's an exit somewhere.
            Find a way out of the cave and head for the aqueduct."
Snake: "All right. But it might take me a while to get through this cave."
Major Zero: "Are you hurt?"
Snake: "No."
Major Zero: "Is it the enemy? Did they set a trap for you?"
Snake: "Not that, either."
Major Zero: "Then what is it?"
Snake: "It's dark in here."
Major Zero: "Dark?"
Snake: "Yeah. There's no light anywhere. I should have brought a flashlight
       with me..."
Major Zero: "So what you're saying is that it's going to take you a while
            because you don't have a flashlight?"
Snake: "Right."
Major Zero: "Snake, if you don't have a flashlight, you should be looking for
            a substitute. I tell you, American soldiers these days rely too 
            much on ready-made equipment."
Snake: "Here we go again..."
Major Zero: "What was that?"
Snake: "Nothing."
Major Zero: "American soldiers rely too much on ready-made equipment. And not
            only that, they can't seem to grasp that one piece of equipment can
            have multiple functions. Back when I was in SAS, we never had that
            problem. We were trained to use ever piece of equipment in as many
            ways as possible. If you don't have a flashlight, look for
            something else. You need to develop flexible innovative thinking if
            you want to... Hey, are you listening to me?"
Snake: "Yeah, of course I am."
Major Zero: "First, take a look at what you're carrying with you now. Don't
            you have anything that can provide you with some light?"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, those hornets that attacked you while you were fighting
            Ocelot..."
Snake: "I know. They look familiar - like the ones I saw during the Virtuous
       Mission."
Major Zero: "So it was one of the Cobras?"
Snake: "That's what Ocelot was saying, too."
Major Zero: "...Keep your guard up."
Snake: "I will."

Para-Medic: "That area is inhabited by the Taiwanese cobra. The Taiwanese cobra
            is native to Taiwan and southern China. It's quite vicious, and
            carries a potent neurotoxin in its fangs. Be careful. If it bites
            you, go into the Survival Viewer immediately and use the 'CURE'
            option to inject yourself with serum."
Snake: "Sounds interesting..."
Para-Medic: "Don't ask me."
Snake: "Huh?"
Para-Medic: "The guide doesn't say. If you absolutely have to know, then you'll
            just have to try it yourself and see."
Snake: "I didn't say anything."
Para-Medic: "But you were going to ask, weren't you? About the taste?"
Snake: "...Maybe."
Para-Medic: "I'll talk to you later, Snake."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, be careful. That cave is inhabited by vampire bats. The
            vampire bat bites its victims and sucks their blood."
Snake: "Got it."
Para-Medic: "Speaking of bats..."
Snake: "Just save it."
Para-Medic: "Huh?"
Snake: "I know you're just going to talk about vampire movies. 'Attack of the
       Vampire Doughnuts' or 'Dracula Versus the Space Hippos' or something
       like that..."
Para-Medic: "Actually, I was going to say that bats are known to use supersonic
            waves to sense their surroundings."
Snake: "Oh."
Para-Medic: "Bats use supersonic waves to sense their surroundings. So you 
            might be able to keep them away by blasting them with a special
            kind of sound wave. As for taste... I suppose there's no reason
            you can't eat them."
Snake: "Hmm..."
Para-Medic: "Snake, do you hate vampire movies?"
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "Just now you sounded like you really hated them."
Snake: "I did?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah."
Snake: "Oh. Well, no one really likes them, do they?"
Para-Medic: "Some people do."
Snake: "Like you?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah. They're fascinating, you know? Like the movie 'Dra...'"
Snake: "Don't say it."
Para-Medic: "Why not?"
Snake: "Just don't."
Para-Medic: "Are you afraid?"
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "You're afraid of vampires, aren't you?"
Snake: "Don't be ridiculous."
Para-Medic: "But..."
Snake: "Listen, there are no such things as vampires. They're just a stupid
       made-up legend. Even if they do seem real sometimes."
Para-Medic: "Well, sure."
Snake: "You think I'd be afraid of something like that?"
Para-Medic: "No."
Snake: "Exactly!"
Para-Medic: "Right."
Snake: "I'm not afraid of vampires."
Para-Medic: "Uh huh."
Snake: "...It's just that whenever somebody starts talking about vampires, I
       end up dreaming about them at night. And I don't need that right now.
       That's all."
Para-Medic: "...OK...???"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, it says here you can catch maroon sharks in that area. The
            maroon shark is found mostly in Southeast Asia. But it's not 
            actually a shark - it's related to the carp. It's also known as the
            red finned cigar shark, the river barb, and the sultan fish."
Snake: "Interesting. So how does it taste?"
Para-Medic: "According to the guide...it's good. But it's kind of oily and has
            a lot of little bones."
Snake: "Fine with me. I never worry about the little things."
Para-Medic: "So I gathered."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is home to the Kenyan mangrove crabs. The Kenyan
            mangrove crab is a land-going crab. It lives in burrows dug near
            seashores and mangrove swamps. It's not poisonous, but it might 
            hurt a little if it attacks you with its pincers. Treat it with
            caution."
Snake: "Got it. So this thing must taste pretty good, huh?"
Para-Medic: "Why do you say 'must'?"
Snake: "It's a crab, isn't it?"
Para-Medic: "It is."
Snake: "And crabs are good to eat."
Para-Medic: "What's so good about them?"
Snake: "You don't like crab?"
Para-Medic: "Not at all."
Snake: "Why not?"
Para-Medic: "Why? How can you eat those things? Ther've all purple and yellow
            striped, and they stink like cat pee..."
Snake: "...?"
Para-Medic: "But that's just my opinion, don't listen to me. Let's see here.
            The guide says...no way. It says they're delicious. Well, if you
            want to eat one, then you go right ahead. But count me out."
Snake: "..."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, there's a mushroom called the Russian glowcap growing in
            that area. The Russian glowcap is a kind of luminescent fungus -
            a mushroom that glows in the dark."
Snake: "Why would a mushroom glow in the dark?"
Para-Medic: "It's bioluminescent, just like a firefly. It uses the so called
            luciferin-luciferase reaction. To put it simply, luciferin reacts
            with luciferase in the present of magnesium two plus ions, breaks
            it down into oxyluciferin and carbon dioxide. The carbonyl groups
            in the oxyluciferin are initially in an electrically excited state.
            When they return to their base state, they give off light. Did you
            get all that?"
Snake: "Not really."
Para-Medic: "Oh. By the way, does that mushroom recharge your batteries when
            you eat it?"
Snake: "Huh?"
Para-Medic: "I mean, it seems like if you ate a glowing mushroom, it might
            recharge your batteries or something. Snake, your batteries are
            organic batteries. They produce electricity by utilizing the
            potential difference between cells. Organic batteries are known
            for their highly efficient energy conversion, but they still rely
            on chemical reactions between proteins and enzymes to..."
Snake: "So you're saying they'll get recharged?"
Para-Medic: "Believe what you want."
Snake: "Great!"

---

Snake: "Para-Medic."
Para-Medic: "What's up?"
Snake: "You were right."
Para-Medic: "About what?"
Snake: "I ate a Russian glowcap and it charged up my batteries."
Para-Medic: "Huh!?"
Snake: "What's wrong?"
Para-Medic: "I, uh...that's...that's great! Um, Snake, can you excuse me for
            a second?"
Snake: "Sure."
[-She goes to talk to someone, and Snake can overhear.]
Para-Medic: "Did you just hear that?"
??????????: "Yeah. There's no way eating a bioluminescent mushroom would cause
            your batteries to recharge."
Para-Medic: "What do you think it means?"
??????????: "Beats me...maybe it's all in his mind."
Para-Medic: "You mean like a placebo effect?"
??????????: "Why not? You've seen how gullible he is."
Para-Medic: "I guess there's no harm done. Should we let him keep believing it?
??????????: "Sounds good to me."
Para-Medic: "OK, Snake, I'm back. Yes, the Russian glowcap is a glowing
            mushroom, so it'll recharge your batteries when you eat it."
Snake: "???"

Sigint: "A torch? A little primitive but, a light's a light. From what I can
        tell, that torch is made of white birch dipped in turpentine. It burns
        long, so I don't think you'll a problem with it burnin' out on you. If
        you equip it and press the CQC Button, you can use it to smack the
        enemy. You can also swing it around by pressing that button repeatedly.
        Useful when you need to clear the room of bats and stuff. With the
        Weapon Button, you can light and extinguish the torch, so make sure
        that thing is out if an enemy is closing in. Get used to it. The light
        from the torch is visible from a long way off, though. It probably goes
        without saying, but marching inot battle with a torch in your hand is
        not the sanest course of action. You should only light a torch when
        you're someplace like a cave where you can't find your way around 
        without a light."
Snake: "Yeah, I hear you."

---

Sigint: "Ah, I see you got yourself an M37. The M37 is a 12-gauge pump-action
        shotgun. Don't expect any kind of accuracy from a distance, but one
        blast will send the enemy flying, and it's got some serious firepower
        too. Good thing to have with you in close-range combat. It takes 
        awhile to reload, though, so plan accordingly. The thing that really
        distinguishes the M37 is that it's light weight. It's about 2 pounds
        lighter than other shotguns. In fact, it's so light that it's been
        nicknamed the 'Featherlight.' Yeah, and to top it off, this one's
        had its barrel and stock sawed off. That's probably a modification
        to make it easier to wield in the jungle. Those Soviet boys know
        what they're doing. I guess the other distinguishing feature would
        be the lack of an ejection port on the side of the receiver.
Snake: "Ambidexterous, huh."
Sigint: "Exactly. It's been designed so you can use it left-handed or right-
        -handed with equal ease. But that's not all. The lower number of
        apertures means that it won't get jammed up as much with mud and
        dirt when you use it out in the field. This weapon is made for the
        jungle."
Snake: "Good to know. But what are they doing with an American-made shotgun?"
Sigint: "Good question. I guess they could be doing research on Western
        weapons, but... Did you ever hear about the SAS using shotguns in
        jungle combat in Malaya?"
Snake: "Just stories."
Sigint: "In the jungle, you're always running into the enemy when you least
        expect it. The SAS found the shotgun to be extremely effective
        delivering massive firepower in a short period of time. Because of
        that, lately a lot of point men are starting to use shotguns as 
        their weapon of choice. Volgin's men might be trying that tactic 
        out for themselves."

---

EVA: "Snake, are you all right?"
Snake: "Yeah...just barely. What the hell were all those hornets..."
EVA: "Most likely that was The Pain, one of the Cobras."
Snake: "I figured as much... Are they tracking me?"
EVA: "I don't know. The Cobras only take orders from The Boss. Not even Volgin
     knows what they're really up to. So I don't know anything about them
     either."
Snake: "No kidding..."
EVA: "I'll try to dig up as much as I can about them. You can just focus on
     moving ahead. Go to the end of the cave and you'll come out in an aqueduct
     overgrown with mangroves. This leads to the Ponizovje swamp. And Snake...
     be careful. That cave... ...is pitch dark inside. Good, I did remember to
     tell you, then."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "If it's completely dark and you need a light, try using a torch."

---

EVA: "That cave is known as Chyornaya Peschera. In Russian, Chyornaya Peschera
     means 'the black cave from which cold wind blows.' It's a magma cavern
     formed millions of years back, back when Tselinoyarsk was the site of
     volcanic activity. The structure of the cave is pretty complex, but you
     should be able to find the aqueduct if you keep moving forward. Head 
     toward the interior of the cave."

---

Snake: "EVA, I wanted to ask you about Ocelot..."
EVA: "Yeah, I know. He's pretty infatuated with you, isn't he?"
Snake: "That's not what I meant. Aren't the Ocelots an elite unit?"
EVA: "Yeah."
Snake: "Then how'd he get to be their commander? He can't be any older than
       18 or 19. I can't believe he's already a major..."
EVA: "I heard from the Colonel that he's been given...special treatment."
Snake: "Special treatment?"
EVA: "Yeah. He's the son of some legendary hero or something."
Snake: "No wonder he seems to have the right stuff... So who is this legendary
       hero, anyway?"
EVA: "Beats me."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "The Colonel never told me. All I heard was that his mother was supposedly
     shot in the gut during battle and that he was born right there, bullets
     whizzing past them."
Snake: "A pregnant women in the middle of a battle?"
EVA: "That's what I heard. They say that when the stitched her up, the scar was
     shaped like a snake."
Snake: "Well, that's battlefield medicine for you. What about his father, this
       legendary hero?"
EVA: "He didn't tell me. I don't think Ocelot's ever met his parents."
Snake: "Are they dead?"
EVA: "Maybe, I don't know. There were a lot of MIAs back then, during the last
     days of the war. Ocelot probably would have ended up the same way. But he
     was taken in and raised by GRU and Volgin."
Snake: "Because he was special?"
EVA: "That's my guess."

18) The Pain Battle
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, as long as The Pain is using his hornets to protect his
            body, you won't be able to damage him with gun attacks. You''ll
            need to use a grenade to get rid of the hornet swarm first. Go
            into the First Person View and throw a grenade at him! The shotgun
            should work as well. Get rid of those hornets protecting him and
            then attack him with a gun!"

---

Major Zero: "The Pain seems to be directing swarms of hornets to attack you. 
Para-Medic: "Be careful. If you're attacked by a swarm of hornets, your LIFE
            will steadily decrease. When the hornets come to attack you, you
            can cause the swarm to scatter by shooting at it with your gun.
            Also, the hornets can't follow you into the water, so you can get
            away by diving into the water. Hornets are also vulnerable to fire
            and smoke. You can keep them away from you by using a smoke
            grenade. Swinging a torch around using the CQC Button should also
            work."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, watch out for those bullet bees he shoots! 'Bullet bees'
            are the name The Pain gives to the special hornets he raises inside
            his own body. If they get into your body, your wounds will become
            worse and worse until you get rid of them."
Para-Medic: "And if you're afflicted by bullet bees, go into the Survival 
            Viewer immediately and use 'CURE' to dig them out with your knife.
            Once the bullet bees are out, don't forget to apply styptic and
            disinfectant to the wound!"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, if The Pain's hornets stick to you, you won't be able to
            move freely. If hornets start to stick to you, take care of them
            before they prevent you from moving altogether. Either jump into
            the water, or wave your survival knife around to drive them away.
            If you become unable to move, wiggle the left analog stick and
            press the buttons rapidly to shake them off before you get off.
            Understood?"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, not even The Pain's special hornets can pursue you into the
            water. And the grenades he throws at you will only be half as 
            deadly underwater. If you sense danger, escape by diving into the 
            water. To dive underwater, press the Crawl Button while you're 
            swimming on the surface. To move forward underwater, press either 
            the CQC Button or the Crawl Button. Use the left analog to control
            your direction. In a pinch, you can press the Action Button to
            quickly rise to the surface. Also, handguns and rifles can be
            fired underwater. You can use these to attack targets above the
            surface as well."

---

Major Zero: "The Pain can utilize the hornets under his control to seek out
            his enemies. Being spotted by the hornets is the same as being
            spotted by him. Keep an eye out for hornets above you when you
            emerge from underwater!"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, you won't be able to see a thing with a swarm of hornets
            covering your head. The hornets can't follow you into the water.
            If you find your vision being blocked by a swarm of hornets, dive
            into the water! You could also try driving them away with the smoke
            from your cigar. Waving your torch around with the CQC button 
            should also work."

---

Para-Medic: "You might be able to trap some of the hornets by throwing a
            hornets' nest at them. If you succeed, it should reduce the
            number of hornets The Pain has at his disposal. It might even make
            the nest taste better. Try it out!"

---

Para-Medic: "Hornets are known to display extremely aggressive behavior in
            response to the color black. So don't wear black clothing. Instead,
            try wearing white clothing. It should reduce the severity of the
            hornets' attacks."

---

Para-Medic: "Using insecticidal bug juice on yourself should make the hornets'
            attacks less severe. Try it out."

---

Para-Medic: "When the hornets come to swarm you, you can cause the swarm to
            scatter by shooting at it with your gun. Also, the hornets can't
            follow you into the water, so you can get away by diving into the
            water. Hornets are also vulnerable to fire and smoke. You can keep
            them away from you by using a smoke grenade. Swinging a torch 
            around using the CQC Button should also work."

---

Sigint: "The Pain is said to possess the power to control his hornets at will.
        Watch out for insect-based attack, especially his so-called 'bullet
        bees.'"

---

Sigint: "The Pain doesn't just use hornets. He's got guns and grenades in his

Sigint: "Snake, watch out for those bullet bees. 'Bullet bee' is the pet name
        The Pain gave to a special type of hornet that he keeps inside his
        body. When The Pain gives the order, they fly at their target like
        bullets, burrow into his body, and eat away at his insides until he's
        dead. If you get hit by a bullet bee, go into the Survival Viewer right
        away and heal yourself on the 'CURE' screen. That being said, despite
        the name, a bullet bee is really just a type of hornet. They can't
        follow you into the water. If The Pain launches any at you, dive under
        the water."

Sigint: "The Pain can supposedly use his hornets to create a copy of himself
        and confuse the enemy. If he does that, try and figure out which one
        is real and attack it. When he copies himself, the hornets that 
        normally protect him will be used to create the double. That means
        you'll be able to damage him with a gun. But be warned. If you screw
        up and shoot the double, or you take too long to shoot, you'll get hit
        with a counterattack."

EVA: "The Pain has the power to control swarms of hornets at will. Watch out
     for his hornet-based attacks!"

Snake: "Major, why did The Pain explode like that...?"
Major Zero: "It's part of this legend."
Snake: "Legend?"
Major Zero: "The legend of the Cobra unit. I'll let Sigint explain. Sigint?"
Sigint: "Yeah, that. That's a microbomb."
Snake: "A microbomb?"
Sigint: "Yep. During World War II, the Cobra unit was used for the nastiest
        kinds of wet works, the kind that could never be let out into the open.
        Their missions were so top secret that not only were they forbidden to
        be taken prisoner, they couldn't even leave their corpse behind. 
        Because of this, or so the legend goes, they carried a microbomb with
        them on their missions in case they needed to commit suicide. I always
        thought it was just a rumor... I never expected it'd turn out to be 
        true."
Snake: "..."
Sigint: "But why would they be carrying bombs this time around? It's not like
        they're in hostile territory."
Snake: "...Maybe they're ready to die."
Sigint: "Ready to die?"
Snake: "Yeah... They've got no unit to go back to. Not even a country."
Sigint: "So they've got no place to die except the battlefield, huh?"
Snake: "Yeah, no turning back for them... I wonder if The Boss feels the
       same..."

Sigint: "Snake, what's that camouflage...?"
Snake: "It's called 'hornet stripe.' I got it from The Pain."
Sigint: "No kidding. Sounds like a pretty unique design. From the looks of
        it, it's somehow infused with the power of hornets."
Snake: "The power of hornets?"
Sigint: "Sure. When you're wearing that outfit, hornets won't attack you.
        Neither will spiders or leeches. You might even be able to tame
        the ones that come flying out of a hive."

EVA: "Snake, you beat The Pain!"
Snake: "Not without a tough fight."
EVA: "How did it feel to fight one of The Boss' comrades?"
Snake: "What are you getting at?"
EVA: "I just want to know what it's like to have fought a member of the
     legendary Cobra unit, that's all."
Snake: "What you want to know is if I can really face The Boss, is that right?"
EVA: "Well, that, too."
Snake: "Don't waste your time worrying about me. I'll get the mission done."
EVA: "I certainly hope so."
Snake: "So the exit of the cave is up ahead?"
EVA: "Right."
Snake: "Go to the end of the cave and you'll come out in an aqueduct overgrown
       with mangrove. This leads to the Ponizovje swamp."

---

EVA: "I heard a report that they've transported a sniper rifle to the western
     part of Ponisovje, the aqueduct at the other end of the cave. When you get
     to the aqueduct, you might want to head over that way and check it out."

EVA: "Pass through that area to the north and you'll reach the aqueduct. But
     be careful - the aqueduct is patrolled by flying platforms."
Snake: "Flying platforms?"
EVA: "Soldiers hovering in the air."
Snake: "I've heard stories, but..."
EVA: "They've already been implemented over here. It goes to show that America
     isn't number one in everything."

[AFTER SEEING CUTSCENE WITH HOVERING SOLDIERS:]

Para-Medic: "I see you've captured a poison dart frog. . The poison dart frog
            is native to the tropical rain forests of Central and South 
            America. They normally grow between two and five centimeters in
            length, but for some reason the ones in that area seem to be much
            bigger than that. Poison dart frogs are known to carry a potent 
            neurotoxin called pumiliotoxin. Long ago, people used the poison
            to coat their arrows for hunting. Watch out because if you eat one,
            you'll get food poisoning."

---

Para-Medic: "That area is home to the Thai cobra. The Thai cobra is a large
            venomous snake that carries an extremely potent neurotoxin. Be
            careful not to get bitten. If you do get bitten, go into the
            Survival Viewer right away and use 'CURE' to give yourself a serum
            injection. The Thai cobra originally comes from Indochina, 
            Thailand, and southern China. The ones in that area were probably
            imported as pets and research subjects before they escaped and
            turned feral."
Snake: "Not as food?"
Para-Medic: "Come again?"
Snake: "They weren't imported as food?"
Para-Medic: "They're NOT for eating."
Snake: "So they don't taste good then."
Para-Medic: "That's not my point. It's not a matter of whether they taste good
            or not. People don't raise snakes for food, period."
Snake: "OK...so, you're saying they might be good to eat, right?"
Para-Medic: "...Only one way to find out."

---

Para-Medic: "It sounds like you've got food poisoning. Food poisoning is
            caused by eating poisonous food. When you have food poisoning,
            your LIFE will continuously decrease. If left untreated, you'll
            eventually throw up whatever it was that you ate. That'll get rid
            of the food poisoning, but you'll also use up a lot of stamina. So
            it's a good idea to get rid of the food poisoning before you vomit.
            To cure food poisoning, go into 'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and
            take some antidote."

Major Zero: "I see you've found your way to the aqueduct. If you follow it to
            the north, you'll come to a warehouse used or transporting 
            supplies. Pass through the warehouse and you'll come out into a
            forest. The lab where Sokolov is being held is directly to the
            north of that forest, so head north."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, EVA mentioned something about a sniper rifle in the
            western part of Ponizovje. A sniper rifle would certainly be a
            valuable asset to your mission. Swing by the western area and
            acquire that sniper rifle."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, the water in that aqueduct comes up to your waste. 
            Naturally, you won't be able to walk as fast as usual. But you can
            jump into the water with a roll or press the Crawl Button to go 
            underwater and swim your way through. The controls when you're
            underwater are quite different from when you're on land. The
            left analog stick controls the direction you're facing. Press up,
            down, left, or right to turn in that direction. Press the CQC
            Button or the Crawl Button to move forward. Each button press will
            move you one stroke forward. Press the button repeatedly to swim
            faster. You can also press the Action Button to surface in an
            emergency. While you're swimming, you can use the right analog
            stick to look in a different direction without changing the 
            direction you're going."

---

Major Zero: "EVA mentioned that the area was guarded by flying platforms. Be
            careful. They can see a great distance from up there. If a flying
            platform starts to draw near, you'd do well to dive underwater and
            hide until it passes."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, that area is home to the bigeye trevally. The bigeye
            trevally is a type of mackerel. The adult fish lives around coral
            reefs, but the young can be found in fresh water area such as
            estuaries and rivers."

---

Sigint: "You say they have flying platforms out there? Flying platformers are
        a type of personal VTOL aircraft."
Snake: "They were working on those in America, too, weren't they?"
Sigint: "Yeah, back in the 50's. They were supposedly going to be used for
        scouting and patrol missions, as well as to spot for artillery units
        and transport troops into rough territory. They even got an initial
        prototype off the ground in 1955. But the thing wasn't fast enough,
        and there were problems with getting it to stop and turn in mid-air.
        So they ended up scrapping the project. The ones you see there were
        built by the Soviets after they got their hands on the American design
        plans. The American model used a pair of contra-rotating motors to
        generate lift. But those Soviet models seem to be using jet engines
        instead. They must have kept going with their research after the U.S.
        abandoned its own project. Now they've finally overtaken us. You gotta
        give them credit for sticking with it. If you get spotted by an enemy
        riding a flying platform, they'll go into Alert Phase. The flying
        platforms themselves don't seem to be armed, but the pilots are
        carrying Scorpion submachine guns and grenades. The recoil on the
        Scorpion is low enough so that they should be able to fire one-handed
        in full-auto mode. That gives them some serious firepower."

---

Sigint: "The armor plating on the body of a flying platform is bound to be
        pretty thick. I don't think you're gonna be able to penetrate it with
        a handgun or an assault rifle. When you're up against a flying
        platform, try and aim for either the pilot or the engine on the
        underbelly."

---

Sigint: "The flying platforms have a searchlight attached to the front. If you
        knock it out, that should handicap its scouting ability. And in some
        cases, it might even have to go back to base for repairs."

Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "Then Sokolov must have been taken back to the lab. Get to the lab
            and get Sokolov the hell out of there. Pass through that warehouse

            Button."

Major Zero: "The assault rifle can punch through materials like wooden

Snake: "They eat their own...?"
Para-Medic: "That's right. It's called caecal feces. When the rabbit eats
            fiber, the fier is fermented in the rabbit's appendix, or caecum,

Para-Medic: "Isn't it?"
Snake: "Yeah. So how does it taste?"
Para-Medic: "Huh?"
Snake: "How does it..."

Snake: "I heard you. But if I did eat it, it might taste good right?"
Para-Medic: "...I give up."

Sigint: "There seem to be traps planted throughout that area. And they look a
        little...primitive..."
Snake: "Yeah. But this is their territory. Why would they need this many traps
       here?"
Sigint: "Maybe it's part of some kind of tactical research."
Snake: "Tactical research?"
Sigint: "Yeah. As I'm sure you know, the Soviet Union is leading a worldwide
        revolution among Communist forces all over the globe. But a lot of
        countries involved don't have the necessary funds and industrial
        technology. So they need tactics that are both effective and
        economical."
Snake: "That's what they're researching?"
Sigint: "Yeah. And traps are one of the best ways to do that. I'll bet that
        place is one of their testing grounds. Clappers, arrows, pendulums -
        all of these traps are set off by applying force to a rope. Don't
        touch the traps, and you'll be fine. Use rolling to get over them, or
        just crawl under them. Either way ought to work. If you do set off a
        trap and an arrow or a spiked pendulum comes flying your way, you can
        still dodge it by immediately diving out of the way. Pit traps and
        snares are camouflaged into the ground and make them harder to detect.
        But if you look carefully enough, you can see them through the
        disguise. Try stalking to proceed with extra caution. In any case, if
        you think there might be traps lying around, keep a close eye on the
        ground and stay alert."

Para-Medic: "That area is home to a small bird called the Red Avadavat. The Red
            Avadavat is a small bird native to Southern China and Southeast
            Asia. This is its mating season, so the males ought to be a

Major Zero: "Snake, that building next to you is an enemy armory. As you might
            have guessed, those armories you sometimes run into are where they
            keep their ammo and other stuff. If you take out an armory, the
            enemy units in the area will have their ammo supply cut off. And
            if they know they're on their last leg, they'll use ammo a little
            more sparingly in a gunfight. Bottom line - if you blow up an 
            armory, the enemy's firepower decreases. By destroying an armory,
            you can cut off the enemy's supply of ammunition. That should make
            your job a lot easier."

Sigint: "Snake, you've got a... I know. It's some new kind of rifle out of the
        West. Looks kind of like a 'black rifle'... No, it's not an AR-15. It's
        an XM16E1, a top-of-the-line rifle that the Army adopted recently on a
        trial basis. The U.S. military was working on a new concept for a light
        infantry weapon from the late 40's through the mid 50's. In the end,
        they decided they wanted a .22-caliber, high muzzle velocity rifle with
        full-auto capability. What they came up with was the AR-15, the so-
        -called 'black rifle.' The one you've got there, the XM16E1, is a
        modified AR-15 that's been fitted with a bolt forward assist. I heard
        they're doing performance evaluations down in Southeast Asia."
Snake: "So they captured one in Vietnam and brought it here?"
Sigint: "That's my guess. But the thing looks a lot different from a regular
        XM16E1. There must have been a gunsmith present at the field tests who
        made all these modification [sic] on the spot. The fact that it's
        painted in camouflage colors shows that more and more people these days
        are starting to realize the importance of camouflage."
Snake: "They made it so it takes a suppressor, too."
Sigint: "Yep. That's a nice feature to have for a recon unit on a sneaking
        mission deep in enemy territory. You can attach and detach the
        suppressor by opening the Weapon Window and pressing the Enter Button.
        Oh, and the firing mechanism's been modified to enable three-shot
        bursts."
Snake: "Why the hell would they do that?"
Sigint: "These days, a lot of new recruits aren't used to firing in full-auto
        mode. They have no trigger control and end up emptying the whole clip
        at once. Maybe they were experimenting with ways to prevent that and
        came up with the burst mechanism as a possible solution."
Snake: "Stupid idea if you ask me."
Sigint: "Hey, give it a chance, it might come in handy. Open the Weapon Window
        and press the Action Button to switch between semi-auto, full-auto, and
        3-shot burst modes. Have fun with that."

            very tight. You'll find it difficult to look for Sokolov unless
            you're disguised as a scientist. Use the clothes that EVA gave you
            to disguise yourself as a scientist. To disguise yourself as a
            scientist, go into the Survival Viewer and select 'SCIENTIST' from
            the 'UNIFORM' option on the 'CAMOUFLAGE' screen. Just remember to

            before he can use the alarm system."

Major Zero: "I see you're disguised as a scientist. It suits you rather
            nicely. As long as you don't do anything suspicious, like roll
            or crawl, the enemy should have no reason to suspect you. Sokolov
            is somewhere inside that lab. Find out where he is and make
            contact with him. If you want to know where Sokolov is, why don't
            you ask the people around there?"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, your disguise seems to be working. But don't forget that
            you're trying to pass as a scientist. Don't do anything that a
            scientist wouldn't do, like roll or crawl. And certainly don't go
            around punching people. If an enemy starts to suspect something,
            don't run away. Stay where you are and remain still. That should
            get you out of most situations.

---

Major Zero: "Snake, be careful of those scientists as well. If they get a
            good look at your face, they'll know that you're not one of the
            scientists assigned to the lab. Take care to keep your face hidden
            from the scientists. Even if they figure out who you are, the
            scientists won't attack you, but you'll be in for it if they cry
            out or press one of the alarm switches on the walls. If a scientist
            starts to suspect something, turn your face away until the
            suspicion passes."

Sigint: "Ah, a handkerchief soaked with a knockout drug, you say? With that 
        thing, I'll bet you could put the enemy asleep just by grabbing them
        in CQC. You could also press the Weapon Button to wave the hanky

Snake: "No, he wasn't lying."
Major Zero: "How can you be so sure?"
Snake: "Gut feeling."
Major Zero: "...Good enough for me. According to Granin, you should be able to

Snake: "Right. Then if I climb the mountains, there'll be an underground tunnel
       leading to Grosnyj Grad near the summit."
Major Zero: "Start out by going back to the warehouse. Use the key you got from
            Granin to open the door and proceed into the jungle. You remember
            where the door is, don't you? It's directly north of the door you
            went in when you came from the aqueduct."

Snake: "Sigint, Granin said something about putting legs on a tank. Do you
       know what he was talking about?"
Sigint: "If you ask me, it's got to be a joke. Not only is making a tank walk
        on two legs a technical nightmare, but there's no point in making a
        walking tank to begin with. Putting legs on a tank would raise its
        clearance, increasing its frontal projection area. It'd also be less
        stable. Suppose the legs help the tank travel bad roads... I don't see
        the logic in that. Isn't that what treads are for? I mean, anyone who'd
        seriously consider making a thing like that has got to be a wacko.
        ...Come to think of it, there was a guy in the States who wrote a paper
        on that subject. What was his name... Emerson? Heinrich? ...Something
        like that; I don't really remember. 'Course, no one took that
        seriously."

Sigint: "Uh huh."
Snake: "Do you have any idea what he meant?"
Sigint: "...Sorry. Beats me."
Snake: "Hmm..."
Sigint: "I wonder if it's supposed to increase the tank's mobility...or maybe
        give the tank short-range missile launching capability... But you're
        sure it has something to do with Phase 2 of the Shagohod, right?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Sigint: "Khrushchev traded Cuba just to get this thing finished, and Volgin
        blew up a Soviet research facility to get his hands on it. Whatever it
        is, it's gotta be big."

        stashed away somewhere. 'Philosopher's Legacy' huh... Maybe it is
        real..."

        prestigious award in the Soviet Union. It's given to individuals,

        science, industry, the arts, and various other fields. You could say
        it's the highest honor the East has to give."

Sigint: "You say Granin was involved in the development of the SS-1C? The SS-1C
        is the Soviet's newest short-range ballistic missile. Based on what
        Western intel has been able to gather, it's capable of being launched
        from a mobile platform."
Snake: "A mobile platform?"
Sigint: "Yeah. It's a transport vehicle that functions as an erector and
        launcher. It can travel on roads and erect and launch a missile from
        any location. Of course, in addition to conventional explosives, the
        missiles could also be fitted with chemical or even nuclear warheads."
Snake: "A nuclear missile that can be launched from any location..."
Sigint: "I'll bet it wasn't the missile itself that Granin helped develop.
        More likely it was the mobile platform. From what I've heard, the SS-1C
        is set for actual deployment as early as next year. That's bound to

            the Survival Viewer and use 'CURE' to give yourself a serum
            injection! The serum will neutralize the poison, but don't forget
            to treat the bolt wound itself as well. To treat a bolt wound, 
            you'll need your knife, a styptic, and a disinfectant. Use your
            knife to dig out the bolt, and then apply styptic and disinfectant
            to the wound. Follow those steps and the wound should heal right
            up. Now start the treatment. Hurry!!"

Major Zero: "The Fear is using something called stealth camouflage to conceal
            himself. But you should be able to spot him if you look closely in
            First Person View. Watch for rustling grass, falling leaves, 
            anything that will betray his presence. Find him and shoot him in
            First Person View."

---

Major Zero: "The Fear's stealth camouflage apparently drains his stamina rather
            quickly. Once he's used up his stamina, he'll have no choice but to
            go looking for food. That's your chance. Throw one of your food
            items to set a trap for him. Plant a Claymore or some TNT and lure
            him into it, or lure him into one of his own traps. Giving him
            poisoned or rotten food may also work well. Used properly, your
            food can be a weapon."

            can't dodge a bolt, go into First Person View and shoot it down."

            attack you by setting it off himself. Be careful about standing
            too close to traps. On the other hand, you might be able to use
            his own traps against him. For example, you could place some food
            next to a trap and lure him over to it. Use your head!"

            Survival Viewer immediately and use 'CURE' to give yourself a serum
            injection. You can get serum by capturing the rabbits that live in
            that area. After you neutralize the poison with the serum, don't
            forget to treat the wound itself, too. To treat a bolt wound,
            you'll need your knife, a styptic, and a disinfectant. Use your
            knife to dig out the bolt, and then apply styptic and disinfectant

            wandering spider. The Brazilian wandering spider is said to have
            the deadliest venom of any spider in the world. It's a potent
            neurotoxin, so if you get hit by one of The Fear's poison bolts,
            go to 'CURE' in the Survival Viewer and inject yourself with serum
            immediately before it kills you!"

---

Para-Medic: "The rabbits in that area have antibodies that protect them against
            the venom of the Brazilian wandering spider. They probably built up
            an immunity from The Fear using them to test his poison bolts. 
            Catching one of those rabbits will give you some serum. If you run
            out of serum, go catch a rabbit!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, The Fear is supposed to be wearing some kind of stealth camo. I
        don't know how it works exactly, but it seems to refract the light
        around it somehow to hide the person who's wearing it. This is the best
        camouflage I've ever seen. It's going to be tough to figure out where
        he is. But that doesn't mean he doesn't have a weak point. Apparently,
        wearing stealth camo really drains up your stamina. When he's out of
        stamina, the camo will stop working. Don't miss your opportunity."

---

Sigint: "Just because he's wearing stealth camo doesn't mean he's not there.
        You can still figure out his location by using your sensors. Make use
        of your motion detector and active sonar. The thermal goggles should
        help you out, too."

---

Sigint: "The Fear uses two kinds of crossbows - the Little Joe and the William
        Tell. The Little Joe is designed for proximity combat. It's not that
        powerful, but the reload time is short. The William Tell, on the other
        hand, is used for long-range combat. It takes a while to reload, but
        it's got loads of stopping power. Be careful."

---

Sigint: "In addition to regular crossbow bolts, The Fear uses a variety of
        special bolts, like poison bolts and giant bolts. I've even heard he
        uses bolts with grenades attached to them. If you get hit by any of
        these, you're gonna take some serious damage. Watch out!"

Snake: "It's spider camouflage. It used to belong to The Fear."
Sigint: "Is that right? Well, it's not as good as the stuff The Fear was 
        wearing, but it still seems to have a pretty decent amount of stealth
        capability. From the looks of it, the wearer uses stamina to power the
        stealth function. With this thing on, your Camo Index will stay at a
        high level no matter where you go. But if you run out of stamina, the

Snake: "Spa...?"
Para-Medic: "Spatsa."
Snake: "Spatsa?"
Para-Medic: "Right."
Snake: "Interesting name."
Para-Medic: "Mmm."
Snake: "..."
Para-Medic: "..."
Snake: "So, Para-Medic."
Para-Medic: "What?"
Snake: "What kind of mushroom is a spatsa?"
Para-Medic: "Uh... You really want to know?"
Snake: "I guess so."
Para-Medic: "OK...let's see, the spatsa... Yeah. It's gray..."
Snake: "Hmm."
Para-Medic: "And it grows on the ground..."
Snake: "Yeah...and?"
Para-Medic: "That's all."
Snake: "That's all?"
Para-Medic: "That's all the guide says. OK, so I don't know much about it. Why
            don't you eat one and see? It might be pretty tasty."
Snake: "Eat one and see? What do I look like, a lab rat?"
Para-Medic: "Shhh!"
Snake: "What? What'd I say?"
Para-Medic: "What if the rats hear you? You'll hurt their feelings."
Snake: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, there should be Vine Melons growing in that area. The Vine
            Melon is a kind of melon commonly found in Tsselinoyarsk. Like the
            name says, it's a melon that grows on a vine. The flesh is crisp
            and delicious. The Vine Melon is full of potassium and carotene, so
            it's good for you as well. Next time you see a vine, why not check
            to see if there's a melon growing on it?"

EVA: "The name of that forest is Svyatogornyj. In Russian, it means something
     like 'the sacred mountain path.' The name comes from an old folk tale 
     about mountain spirits who pass through there on their way to Sokrovenno,
     the forest to the north. Head north and you'll come to Sokrovenno. The
     tunnel that leads to the mountains is in the northern area of Sokrovenno.
     I'll meet you in the ruins at the top of the mountains. I'll give you the
     key to the tunnel leading to Groznyj Grad when you get there. Remember,
     go north."
Snake: "But Sokrovenno is also where..."
EVA: "I know."
Snake: "The Ocelots, right?"
EVA: "Yeah. The Ocelot unit is waiting for you in Sokrovenno. I hear they've
     even got snipers in position. Watch your back."

Para-Medic: "Snake, the Ural luminescent mushroom grows in that area. The Ural
            luminescent mushroom is a mushroom found only in Tselinoyarsk. It
            looks like a shiitake mushroom, and it's often found growing on the
            trunks of trees."
Snake: "If it looks like a shiitake mushroom, then it must be edible, right?"
Para-Medic: "Yep. I can't guarantee that it'll taste like a shiitake mushroom,
            though."

EVA: "Snake, I found out what I could about your Tanya. Just as I thought,
     she's apparently Sokolov's lover. When Sokolov was taken away from his
     research facility, she was taken along with him."
Snake: "So she's been with him since he was at the research facility...?"
EVA: "That's what it looks like."
Snake: "Are you sure about that?"
EVA: "Yes. Why?"
Snake: "The major said Sokolov wasn't the kind of guy who'd take a lover..."
EVA: "Maybe he was lonely, being away from his family for so long. And whatever
     else he is, Sokolov's still a man. It's only natural he'd be attracted to
     her."
Snake: "Only natural?"
EVA: "She's irrestistable. Gorgeous, in a girl-next-door kind of way. Nice
     proportions, too."
Snake: "..."

Sigint: "I see you got yourself an M63. The M63 is an American-made system
        weapon."
Snake: "Yeah, I've heard of it before, but..."
Sigint: "...But you've never got your hands on one? Doesn't surprise me - it's
        brand new. They only developed it last year. I'm thinking they probably
        captured some in Southeast Asia and sent them back for research. The
        term 'system weapon' refers to a design where most of the parts are
        interchangable, allowing you to create a lot of different variations
        from a single original model. Using a set of basic components as the
        core, you can mix and match parts to create any number of different
        weapons. It's like a convertible rifle. By switching barrels and 
        magazines around, you can make everything from an assault rifle and a
        carbine to a light machine gun and even a belt-feeding medium machine
        gun. Not only does this save the trouble of having to organize a bunch
        of different weapon on different lines, but it also has the added
        benefit of cutting down on the amount of training needed for each
        soldier. Most of the lost parts are made by press work and lost-wax
        casting, so they can be manufactured in countries that lack a developed
        technological base."
Snake: "Nice touch."
Sigint: "The variation you've got there is the belt-fed light machine gun. It
        was originally designed for use in squad support missions."
Snake: "It's a lot lighter than the M60."
Sigint: "Yeah. You won't find a lighter-weight light machine gun than that. It
        ought to be pretty easy to handle in the jungle. Make good use of it."

===============================================================================
35) Sokrovenno South [The End]
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, The End is a veteran sniper. He's hiding somewhere in those
            woods waiting for you to appear. If he sees you, he'll shoot 
            without hesitation. Make your way through the forest, hiding along
            the way, and watch out for signs of The End. Anticipate his 
            movements and come up on his side or get behind him for a chance to
            attack. Be careful. The End uses a special kind of tranquilizer
            round."
Para-Medic: "If he shoots you with one of those tranquilizer rounds, you'll
            start to lose stamina fast. When your stamina gauge reaches zero,
            you'll pass out. If you're hit by a tranquilizer round, go into the
            Survival Viewer right away and treat the wound. Use your knife to
            dig out the needle."
Major Zero: "If you run out of stamina, it's all over. Make sure you keep your
            stamina up by hunting for food on a regular basis. This battle will
            be a long, grueling sniper duel. But don't let your guard down, not
            even for a single moment!"

---

Major Zero: "The binoculars and First Person View will prove useful in
            detecting the enemy's presence. You should also be making use of
            your motion detector, active sonar, and Anti-Personnel Sensor. You
            might also try using the directional microphone. The thermal 
            goggles should also be effective."

---

Major Zero: "The End is a renowned sniper, but he's also an expert in
            camouflage. He's lying low somewhere in those woods and waiting for
            his chance. You'll only get yourself shot if you run around like a
            fool. Use your camouflage to blend in, take cover behind rocks and
            trees, and find where he's hiding. Make use of your binoculars. 
            Keep a close eye out for the flash from his scope. You can also try
            using the thermal goggles."

---

Major Zero: "The best locations for sniping are determined naturally by the
            terrain. The End may use the same location multiple times. Memorize
            the spots he chooses for sniping, and sneak up behind him. You can
            tell which locations The End has used for sniping by looking at the
            'MAP' in the Survival Viewer. Anticipate where he'll be hiding from
            and approach him from the side or rear."

---

Major Zero: "If you reach the spot where you think The End is hiding and he's
            not there anymore, don't give up. Take a close look at the ground.
            He may have left footprints behind. You can use those to determine
            which way he went. Anticipate his movements and get behind him."

---

Para-Medic: "If you run out of stamina, you won't be able to resist the effects
            of The End's tranquilizer rounds, and you'll end up falling asleep.
            Hunt for food on a regular basis to keep your stamina level up. If
            you start to run out of food or ammunition, you should think about
            leaving the woods and coming back later. In any case, always keep 
            an eye on your stamina gauge. You'll thank me later."

---

Para-Medic: "You can make your LIFE recover faster by staying in a crouched or
            lying position. If you get injured, find someplace where you're 
            safe from enemy attacks and let your LIFE recover! OK?"

---

Sigint: "Sokrovenno Forest is a big place. It's times like these that the 'MAP'
        function in the Survival Viewer can be your best friend. Not only does
        it show you the terrain and the places you've been, but you can also
        use it to figure out which locations The End has chosen for his sniping
        positions. Learn the terrain and try to catch The End off guard from
        behind."

---

Sigint: "Hey, you've got thermal goggles, don't you? Use those and it should
        make it easier to find The End, even when he's camouflaged. A word of
        warning, though -- I've heard that when he's meshing with the forest,
        his body temperature drops so that it's just barely above the outside
        air temperature. He's probably going to be harder to find than your
        average grunt."

---

EVA: "I know it's hard to believe, but The End is apparely capable of
     photosynthesis. He's probably got an edge over you in terms of stamina.
     You should start hunting for plants and animals and prepare for a battle
     of attrition."

---

EVA: "The name of that forest is Svyatogornyj. In Russian, it means something
     like 'the sacred mountain path.' The name comes from an old folk tale 
     about mountain spirits who pass through there on their way to Sokrovenno,
     the forest to the north. Head north and you'll come to Sokrovenno. The
     tunnel that leads to the mountains is in the northern area of Sokrovenno.
     I'll meet you in the ruins at the top of the mountains. I'll give you the
     key to the tunnel leading to Groznyj Grad when you get there. Remember,
     go north."
Snake: "But Sokrovenno is also where..."
EVA: "I know."
Snake: "The End, right?"
EVA: "Yeah. One of the Cobras, The End, is waiting for you in Sokrovenno. He's
     a legendary sniper. Until you defeat him in battle..."
Snake: "I won't be able to move on?"
EVA: "Right." Until you defeat The End, I don't think you'll be able to pass
     through the forest. You'll have to beat him."

---

EVA: "There's an armory in the southern area of Sokrovenno. You can use it to
     replenish your supply of ammo if you start to run out. But stay alert -
     The End might be lying in wait for you there!"

[AFTER BEATING THE END:]

Major Zero: "Rendezvous with EVA at the top of the mountains. According to her,
            the shaft leading to the mountains should be located in the far
            northeastern corner of the forest. Enter the shaft and head into
            the mountains. Proceed to the northeast.

---

Para-Medic: "I see you caught a markhor. The markhor is a kind of wild goat
            that lives in mountainous areas. It's quite large, so I don't
            think you'll be able to capture one alive, even with the 
            tranquilizer gun."
Snake: "All right."
Para-Medic: "Speaking of which, do you know the origin of the name 'markhor'?"
Snake: "No."
Para-Medic: "It means 'snake eater' in Persian."
Snake: "'Snake Eater'..."
Para-Medic: "Lost your appetite?"
Snake: "Not at all. It tasted pretty good. I think I'll have it again
       sometime."
Para-Medic: "..."

---

Sigint: "Snake, what's that you're wearing?...?"
Snake: "It's moss camouflage. I got it from The End."
Sigint: "Interesting. It seems to have part of The End's power sealed within
        it. If you wear it in a place where the sun shines, you'll
        automatically recover stamina. It'll also give you a high rate of
        camouflage in Syvatogornyj and Sokrovenno, The End's home territory."

---

Sigint: "You're using a Mosin Nagant?"
Snake: "Yeah. It's what The End was using."
Sigint: "I see. The M1891/30 Mosin Nagant is a real beauty of a bolt-action
        sniper rifle. It's been in use since World War II. Mosin Nagants are
        created by selecting the best-made weapons out of the regular M1891/30
        rifle production line for their high precision and upgrading them to
        sniper rifles. They add on optical sight, make the trigger pull 
        lighter, bend the charging handle underneath - that kind of stuff. The
        Mosin Nagant has been known far and wide since the war for its superior
        capabilities. They were so highly valued that a lot of German snipers
        on the eastern front preferred to use captured Mosin Nagants instead of
        their own rifles. It looks like The End took the one he'd been using
        since the war and modified it to fire tranquilizer rounds. Yeah. It's 
        also been fitted with a folding stock and a pistol grip."
Snake: "Maybe for parachute jumps?"
Sigint: "Well, I dunno why he did it, but that's the tool of a legendary
        sniper. It's got to be a fine piece of work. But remember - the Mosin
        Nagant is a bolt-action rifle, so you'll have to load a new
        tranquilizer round into the chamber by hand every time you fire. That
        means no repeat firing. One shot, one kill. When you equip a sniper
        rifle, you'll go straight into First Person View. Once you're in
        position, press the Aim Button to look through the scope. The trigger
        is the Weapon Button, as usual. You can change the magnification on the
        scope by pressing the Action Button. You can fire from a standing
        position, but your aim will be a heck of a lot steadier if you're lying
        down. Try it out."

36) Sokrovenno South [Ocelots]
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, be careful. Aren't the Ocelots supposed to be setting an
            ambush for you in those woods?"
Snake: "Yeah. And I hear they've got snipers, too."
Major Zero: "The Ocelots are an elite unit handpicked from the ranks of GRU.
            You won't find them so easy to deal with. Use your camouflage to
            avoid being seen. Proceed with caution. Your primary objective is
            to climb the mountains and rendezvous with EVA. There's no need to
            face the Ocelots in battle. The shaft leading to the mountains is
            located in the northeast part of the northern area of the woods.
            Keep an eye out for ambushes and head northeast."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, be on the lookout for ambushes by the Ocelots? They may be
            hiding in the bushes and similar places. Make sure you're fully
            camouflaged and proceed with caution."

Major Zero: "The binoculars and First Person View will prove useful in

Para-Medic: "Snake, those snipers will be aiming right for your vital spots.
            They're precise, and you're likely to be seriously wounded if you
            get hit. Use your camouflage to sneak past them without being
            seen!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, watch out for ambushes by the Ocelots. Use your motion detector
        and active sonar to help you get ahead."

EVA: "The entrance to the shaft leading to the mountains is in the northeast
     part of the northern area. Take out those Ocelots and head for the shaft!"

EVA: "The forest you're in now is known as Sokrovenno. The name means 'the 
     most holy woods.' It's been venerated since ancient times as the sacred
     home of the spirits of the forest. It's the largest and deepest forest 
     in the region, and is divided into three areas: south, west, and north.
     Try not to get lost, OK? There's an armory in the southern area. If you
     need some extra ammo, you might want to pay it a visit. Be careful. I've
     heard the Ocelots are lying in wait for you in the forest. The entrance to
     the tunnel is in the northeastern part of the northern area. Try to make
     it there in one piece."

---

EVA: "The Ocelots are an elite unit hand-picked from the ranks of Spetsnaz,
     GRU's special forces. So naturally their fighting skills are second to
     none. They're crack shots, and if they hit you, you're likely to be
     seriously wounded. Avoid taking them head on. If they manage to surround
     you in large numbers, you're finished. Use your camouflage to conceal
     yourself from them and keep moving!"

Snake: "Para-Medic, I caught a parrot..."
Para-Medic: "What kind of parrot?"
Snake: "It's green all over, with a large beak."
Para-Medic: "Then it's probably an Alexandrine Parakeet. It's sometimes also
            called the Alexandrine parrot. The Alexandrine Parakeet originally
            comes from Indochina, and is distinguished by its green body and
            red beak. It's very talkative and makes a good pet. But it's
            strange. The guide doesn't say anything about there being
            Alexandrine Parakeets in that area. I'm thinking it must be
            someone's pet that got away."
Snake: "Hmm..."
Para-Medic: "SNAKE!!"
Snake: "What?"
Para-Medic: "Don't EVEN think about it! Eating a cute little bird like that..."
Snake: "But I didn't say..."
Para-Medic: "Just dont!"
Snake: "..."

EVA: "Good, you're in the tunnel. The ladder at the end of the tunnel will take
     you up into the mountains. Head down the tunnel and climb up the ladder."

Snake: "EVA, how are things on your end? Are you going to be able to make it?"
EVA: "I'm fine. I managed to slip out OK, though. I did run into a few snags."
Snake: "Is there a problem?"
EVA: "I took a little detour on my way here."
Snake: "Detour?"
EVA: "Yeah. I thought since you went to all this trouble to meet me, I should
     give you a present."
Snake: "A present? What is it?"
EVA: "You really want to know?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "It's a secret."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "You'll find out when you get here."

38) Krasnogorje Mountain Base
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "You've found your way to the mountains, I see. There's an
            underground tunnel near the top. You can use it to sneak into
            Groznyj Grad. But EVA said the door to the tunnel was sealed off."
Snake: "Yeah. She's supposed to bring me the key."
Major Zero: "First, rendezvous with EVA and get the key from her. The
            rendezvous point is in the ruins at the summit. The summit is still
            further up the mountain. Keep heading up towards the summit."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, Para-Medic has something to tell you."
Para-Medic: "Snake, the altitude in those mountains is pretty high. That means
            the oxygen concentration in the air is lower than normal. When
            there's less oxygen in the air, naturally you'll be breathing less
            oxygen as well, and the oxygen content of your blood will go down.
            In other words, you run the risk of becoming hypoxic. Hypoxia is a
            very serious condition. In the worse cases, it can lead to
            pulmonary and cerebral adema. I don't think you need to worry right
            now, but all the same, be careful."
Snake: "So...what do I need to be careful about?"
Para-Medic: "In high-altitude areas, you will tire quicker than normal."
Snake: "Okay."
Para-Medic: "Snake, climbing uphill takes a lot of stamina as it is. But on top
            of that, the air up there is thinner than normal. You're burning
            through stamina a lot faster now than ever before. Keep an eye on
            your stamina gauge. Be sure to eat something to restore your
            stamina before you run out."

Major Zero: "Snake, watch out for enemy soldiers carrying RPG-7s. A full-on
            rocket blast is not something you can just walk away from.
            However, it takes some time to reload a rocket launcher. Use that
            opening to your advantage."

Para-Medic: "Snake, watch out. That area is home to the emperor scorpion. The
            emperor scorpion is said to be the largest scorpion in the world.
            Its venom is a potent neurotoxin, so take care that you don't get
            stung. If you do get stung, go into the Survival Viewer and use
            'CURE' to inject yourself with serum right away."
Snake: "OK. So how's it taste?"
Para-Medic: "Not very good, I'm afraid."
Snake: "Oh..."
Para-Medic: "Don't get so discouraged. There are other ways to use it besides
            eating it, right?"
Snake: "Like what?"
Para-Medic: "Like catching one alive with the tranquilizer gun and throwing it
            at the enemy."
Snake: "Oh, yeah."
Para-Medic: "Sometimes I wonder if you even remember that you are on a mission.
Snake: "..."

Para-Medic: "There should be white-rumped vultures living in that area. The
            white-rumped vulture is a type of vulture found in India. Its diet
            consists mostly of dead animal carcasses. I don't think it'll 
            attack you, but it's a fairly large bird of prey, so you probably
            won't be able to capture it alive using the tranquilizer gun."
Snake: "Got it."
Para-Medic: "But there is something else here that's bothering me..."
Snake: "What is it?"
Para-Medic: "They say the white-rumped vulture doesn't just eat animal
            carcasses. It eats human ones as well."
Snake: "Is that so?"
Para-Medic: "Yeah."
Snake: "So, then, if a person eats a white-rumped vulture, does that mean he's
       eating human meat, too?"
Para-Medic: "..."
Snake: "What do you think?"
Para-Medic: "Stop it already. You're going to make me lose my appetite."

EVA: "You made it to the mountains. Those mountains are known as Krasnagorje.
     The name means 'the red mountain ridge' in Russian. The entire range has
     been fortified to act as a defense for the great fortress of Groznyj Grad.
     The area near the top has been dug with bunkers and trenches, and there
     are anti-aircraft gun emplacements everywhere. It's literally an 
     impenetrable wall. Proceed with caution. Oh, there's a provisions
     storehouse in the hillside area, and there's an armory at the summit. I'll
     meet you in the ruins at the top of the mountains. The summit is still a
     ways up. Keep going forward."

Snake: "Major, that attack chopper is here..."
Major Zero: "The one from the heliport?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "Perhaps it's an armed variation of the Mi-8 Hip?"
Snake: "No. Some of it looks the same, but the overall shape is different. 
       It's got stub wings, and the cockpit canopy looks like an angular
       greenhouse."
Sigint: "No kidding. Then it must be some kind of new model. I've heard
        stories recently that the Soviets are developing a 'flying infantry
        combat vehicle.' That's got to be it."
Snake: "A flying infantry combat vehicle?"
Sigint: "Yeah. A transport chopper with troop carrying capabilities. Think of
        it as a attack-chopper version of France's AMX-VCI or the Soviet BMP.
        They must be doing field tests on the initial prototype."
Snake: "A next-generation chopper that's a little smaller than the Hip...
       Maybe we should call it a Hind."
Sigint: "Hmm, not bad. It's cool with me."
Major Zero: "Then it's settled. We'll refer to that new-type helicopter as a
            Hind from now on."

---

Major Zero: "The Hind's armor is impenetrable to normal fire such as rifle
            bullets. But if you take over one of the anti-aircraft guns placed
            throughout the mountain, you should be able to take it on. What
            else could you use against a Hind... I suppose a rocket launcher
            might do the trick..."

---

Sigint: "The Hind is armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun on the nose and rocket
        pods and anti-tank missiles on the stub wing hard points... Normally,
        you'd be crazy to try and fight it on foot. It if starts attacking with
        the machine gun or the rockets, take cover behind something as fast as
        you can. As for the missiles, you should be able to knock out their
        guidance system by using a chaff grenade to block the radio signal."

---

Sigint: "Snake, you see that anti-aircraft gun? That's a ZU-23, a light towable
        anti-aircraft gun that the Soviets started producing in 1957. It was
        designed for deployment in airborne units and motorized rifle divisions
        without their own self-propelled anti-air guns. It's got two 23 mm air-
        -cooled automatic cannons with a firing rate of 800 pounds per minute.
        They usually take a six-man crew to operate, but you ought to be able
        to handle one by yourself. In addition to shooting at low-flying
        aircraft, you can also use them as machine guns to target light-armored
        land vehicles. I imagine they'd be more than a match for that new
        attack chopper of theirs, too. You can take over an anti-aircraft gun
        the same way you take over a gun emplacement - stand next to it and
        press the Action Button. Use the Weapon Button to fire. Press the Aim
        Button to focus in on a target. Just remember that they've got limited
        ammo. Also, don't forget, you can't move around while you're using an
        emplacement. If the enemy's getting too close for comfort, press the
        Action Button to ditch it, pronto."

---

Sigint: "Your assault rifle won't penetrate the Hind's armor. Try the RPG-7.
        If you can take over one of the anti-aircraft guns in the mountains,
        you'll be more than a match for that Hind."

---

Sigint: "The Hind is a transport-attack chopper that can carry personnel. It
        might drop some troops on you. Don't get caught off guard."

---

Sigint: "The Hind is protected by heavy armor, but a rifle bullet should be
        able to penetrate through the cockpit canopy. Try using the SVD."

---

Sigint: "You're using the RPG-7, huh? The RPG-7 is a state-of-the-art portable
        anti-tank weapon developed as the successor to the RPG-2. If first saw
        active deployment in 1962 the year before last. Actually, maybe
        portable's not the right word. The launcher and the grenade together
        weight over 20 pounds. It's not something you can use on the move.
        When you equip it, make sure you use First Person View to aim."
Snake: "Got it."
Sigint: "You can fire it as soon as you're in position, but if you use the Aim
        Button to look through the scope, you should be able to get a pretty
        accurate shot. Then just use the Weapon Button to pull the trigger
        and the propellant will shoot the grenade out of the launcher. 
        Immediately after that, stabilizer fins will deploy from the back of
        the grenade. After it travels about 35 feet, the rocket fuel inside
        the grenade will ignire, accelerating the grenade towards its target.
        Even if it doesn't hit the target, the safety mechanism will kick in
        and cause it to self-destruct when it exceeds the target range or after
        a few seconds of flight. The warhead is made of the plastic explosive
        HEAT. It's capable of penetrating up to 13 inches of armor. That should
        be enough to shoot down a heavily-armored attack chopper. Oh, one more
        thing - the rocket fires when the grenade first starts its descent. So
        don't try to fire it real close to the ground."
Snake: "So, you can't use it from a lying position?"
Sigint: "Right. Don't forget that."
Snake: "I won't."

Snake: "Just my luck. I don't have any weapons that'll work against them..."
EVA: "There should be an RPG-7 in a bunker on the hillside."
Snake: "A portable rocket launcher, huh. That should be enough to swat 
       bothersome flies."
EVA: "You could try using an anti-aircraft gun. You can take over an anti-

            Normal Phase before you attempt to make contact with EVA."

Major Zero: "It looks like there's an anti-aircraft gun emplacement there. You
            can operate an anti-aircraft gun emplacement by standing next to it
            and pressing the Action Button. Use the Weapon Button to control 
            the trigger. You can also zoom in on a target by pressing the Aim
            Button. The anti-aircraft cannon should be more than a match even
            for that attack chopper. But remember, its ammo supply is limited.
            Obviously, you can't move around as long as you're sitting in the
            seat. If the enemy gets too close for comfort, press the Action

            obscure that we simply overlooked it..."
Snake: "Or maybe she's a VIP that all the data on her has been classified."

Snake: "Sigint."
Sigint: "Yo."
Snake: "EVA said she set up a ground effect vehicle for us to make our escape."
Sigint: "So I heard. The ground effect vehicle - or WIG - is something like a
        cross between an airplane and a boat. It uses ground effect to fly.
        Ground effect basically means that when the craft skims the surface of
        the ground, the air between the ground and the wing is compressed, 
        which gives the wing an extra boost. From what Western intelligence
        agencies have been able to gather, the Russians are pretty serious 
        about developing these WIGs. Apparently they're planning on using them
        for anti-submarine patrols. I guess I can see why. The WIG's long
        cruising range and high-speed capabilities make it a good choice for
        that kind of mission. EVA must have gotten her hands on one of the
        first prototypes while it was being field tested as a transport craft.
        The WIG has a top speed of over 400 miles per hour. And its range is
        pretty good, too. Not that speed is going to help you if you've got a
        supersonic jet on your tail, but if you hug the surface and stay off
        the radar, you should have no problems getting away."

            circumstances should you get close to the flame troops. Either
            sneak by without being seen, or take them out from a distance."
Para-Medic: "If you get blasted by a flamethrower, your body will catch on
            fire. If your body catches on fire, either roll around repeatedly
            to put it out, or go into the Survival Viewer and change out of the
            burning clothes. When you catch fire, you'll get burned unless you
            put the flames out quickly. So be sure to extinguish the flames
            right away, OK?"

---

Sigint: "You seen any enemies equipped with flamethrowers? Those flamethrowers
        are M2s. They were first used in World War II durig the invasion of
        Guam. The M2 uses pressurized nitrogen gas to fire a fuel mixture of
        napalm and gasoline. It comes in handy for torchin' places that are 
        tough enough to secure with conventional firepower, like trenches and
        bunkers and pillbox enclosures. Watch out though. Get hit by a
        flamethrower in a narrow spot like a closet or a trench and it's
        barbeque time. Don't wander too close to an enemy carrying a
        flamethrower. If you need to take one out, try sniping from a distance
        so the flames can't reach you."
Snake: "What are they doing with American-made flamethrowers anyway?"
Sigint: "Well, like a lot of other Western weapons, those M2s were probably
        jacked for research purposes. But if they're actually using them...man,
        they must really have it in for you."
Snake: "What do you mean?"
Sigint: "The flamethrower is heavy, short-ranged, and can only be used for a
        short period of time. Not only that, but when a flame trooper gets
        captured, he's almost always put to death. Basically it's a bad idea
        all the way around to use flamethrowers unless you're sweepin'. And
        despite all that, they're keepin' 'em at the ready just for you. What

        Fury's flames when you're wearing the night-vision goggles, though, or
        you'll be blinded by the afterimage for a while. If he fires the
        flamethrower, either look away or take off the goggles. If the
        batteries in the night-vision goggles are used up, you can use a cigar
        or a torch for light. But if you try and get close to him with the
        light on, he'll know you're there. Keep that in mind."

---

Sigint: "That's not an ordinary flamethrower The Fury's using. Normally, 
        flamethrowers use a mixture of napalm and gasoline for fuel. But from
        what I hear, that guy is using liquid rocket fuel. I'm guessing it's
        probably a mixture of UDHM - unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine - And
        NTO - nitrogen tetroxide. I'm sure you've seen how potent that stuff
        is. The Fury's flamethrower is one hell of a weapon. Any frontal attack
        you make it just gonna get swatted down by the flames. You've got to
        circle around him and attack from behind or from the side."

Sigint: "The Fury has a special flameproof outfit made from a spacesuit. If 
        it's tough enough to stand up to those flames he's belching out, 
        grenades and white phosphorous grenades aren't even going to make a 
        dent. Of course, if you manage to tear through that suit, then it's a
        different story. If you use a knife and engage him at close range, you
        should be able to rip right through that flameproof suit of his. To get
        close enough to use your knife, try stalking up behind him. But you've
        got to worry about more than not making noise. Any light you're
        carrying, like a cigar or a torch, will give you away. So when you're
        creepin' upon him, unequip your cigar or torch."

            than his brothers and has the happiest ending of all. That son is
            usually named Ivan."
Snake: "I don't have any brothers."
Major Zero: "Really? I could have sworn you had several."
Snake: "???"

EVA: "The security in the west wing where Sokolov is being held is extremely
     tight. The only ones who are cleared to enter the west wing are those with
     colonel-class authorization. One of those people is Major Raikov. To get
     into the west wing, you could disguise yourself as Raikov. First, you'll
     have to take Raikov out and steal his uniform. He's in the east wing of
     the weapons lab in the center of Groznyj Grad. The east wing is northeast
     of your current location. Head northeast."
Snake: "All right. But why?"
EVA: "Huh?"
Snake: "Why do I have to steal Raikov's clothes from him? What about that
       scientist outfit..."
EVA: "That's not going to work this time around. Raikov's uniform is a special
     type that only he wears. You'll have to get it directly from him. Normally
     I'm pretty good at getting men to take off their clothes, but it won't 
     work on him."
Snake: "?"
EVA: "You, on the other hand, might have a better chance with him."
Snake: "What's that supposed to mean?"
EVA: "What indeed. Anyway, the only way to get Raikov's uniform is to take him
     out and steal it yourself. He's somewhere in the east wing."

Snake: "EVA, about this Major Raikov..."
EVA: "Yes?"
Snake: "You said he had 'colonel-class' authorization, right?"
EVA: "Right."
Snake: "But his rank is major. So how can he have 'colonel-class'
       authorization?"
EVA: "Raikov is treated as an officer of equal rank with Colonel Volgin."
Snake: "Treated as the same rank?"
EVA: "Yeah."
Snake: "Even though he's a major?"
EVA: "Right."
Snake: "Why?"
EVA: "You don't know?"
Snake: "No."
EVA: "Even after seeing that photo?"
Snake: "Nope."
EVA: "Has anyone ever told you you're a bit slow?"
Snake: "What are you talking about?"
EVA: "I'll leave you to think about it."
Snake: "Wait a minute..."
EVA: "Gotta go."

47) Groznyj Grad Weapons Lab: East Wing
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Good, you've infiltrated the east wing. Raikov should be somewhere
            in that building. Take him down and steal his clothes! But you
            can't simply wander around the enemy's home base looking like that.
            For now, disguise yourself as a scientist while you look for
            Raikov. Raikov is somewhere within the east wing. Find him and
            dispatch him!"

---

Major Zero: "Good, you've taken care of Raikov. Now to take those clothes 
            he's wearing. But don't take his clothes off there, out in the
            open. It's far too conspicuous. Also, once you've disguised
            yourself as Raikov, you'll need to find someplace to hide the
            real Raikov's body. There must be a place where you can take
            Raikov's clothes and hide the body. Drag Raikov's body over
            there. EVA might know a suitable location. Try asking her. If
            Raikov's corpse is found, you'll no longer be able to disguise
            yourself as him. Whatever you do, don't let them find the body.
            Is that clear?"


[If you try to leave the building after killing Raikov.]
Major Zero: "Snake, where are you going? Are you planning to just leave 
            Raikov's corpse there? If anyone discovers his body, you won't be
            able to disguise yourself as him anymore. You won't be able to get
            into the West Wing either, and your mission will fail. Hurry up 
            and get back to Raikov's body."

---

Major Zero: "Ah, your Raikov disguise has turned out nicely."
Snake: "Yeah. Not even his own mother could tell the difference."
Major Zero: "Indeed. You're already starting to irritate me."
Snake: "Why? This look should make memore popular."
Major Zero: "I wouldn't be on it. ...But whatever."
Snake: "Now that you're indistinguishable from the real Raikov, you'll be able
       to get into the west wing to which only Volgin and Raikov have access.
       Head for the west wing of the weapons lab. That's where Sokolov is being
       held. Enter the main wing from the second floor of the east wing. Pass
       west through the main wing and you'll come to a connecting passageway.
       The west wing is at the other end of that passageway. Infiltrate the
       west wing and rescue Sokolov."

---

Major Zero: "Now that you're the spitting image of Raikov, no one will have
            cause to suspect you. But if someone finds Raikov hidden in the
            locker, your disguise will become useless. If that happens, your
            mission will end in failure. Whatever you do, don't open the
            locker. Is that clear?"

---

Snake: "Sigint, this door is..."
Sigint: "I heard. The door seems to be set up to open in response to a radio
        signal on a specific frequency. Hey, you've got a device that transmits
        radio signals on different frequencies. Maybe you could use that to
        open it."
Snake: "But the 'key' frequency is probably going to be different for each
       door."
Sigint: "If you need to know which one...why don't you try capturing a
        scientist or a grunt around here and asking them?"

---

Sigint: "I see you're equipped with a Scorpion. The Scorpion is a new type of
        small submachine gun made in Czechoslovakia."
Snake: "I've heard of it, but..."
Sigint: "...But you've never used one, right? Well, they only started making
        it three years ago, after all. There are a bunch of different models
        of Scorpion...what kind of rounds does that one take?"
Snake: ".32ACP."
Sigint: "Then it's gotta be the Vz-61. The Scorpion is different from a lot of
        other submachine guns in taht it operates on a closed bolt system. So
        you get a high degree of precision even when firing in semi-auto mode.
        Another special feature on the Scorpion is the rate reducer, a
        mechanism that also functions as a shock absorber.  What it does is
        lock the bolt in place for a split second when it's in the rearward
        position. That keeps the firing rate down to a reasonable level, and
        also helps make the gun easier to control when firing in full-auto
        mode. The Scorpion's firing rate is 750 rounds per minute. It ought
        to be a heck of a lot easier to control than the MAC11, which has a
        rate of 1200 rounds per minute. You should be able to handle it with
        one hand no problem in semi-auto mode. In full-auto mode, you could
        probably manage short bursts. And it looks like that one's fitted with
        a laser sight, too. The Soviets probably developed this one on their
        own. You can't use the Aim Button to aim from the shoulder, but with
        the laser sight accuracy it shouldn't be that big of a problem."

---

Sigint: "OK, you're disguised as Raikov. You ought to pass for the real deal
        in that outfit. You can go anywhere you want and nobody's going to
        ask questions. But don't forget that you can't equip most of your
        weapons when you're in disguise."

---

[If you try opening a locked door:]
EVA: "Snake, that door can't be opened by normal means. Apparently, it operates
     by responding to a specific radio frequency. If you want to know the 'key'
     frequency...why don't you try asking someone nearby?"

---

EVA: "You took care of Raikov? Good. Now drag him to the locker room. There
     shouldn't be anyone in there. You won't need to worry about anyone seeing
     you take his clothes, and you can hide his body, too. The locker room is
     on the southwest side of the second floor. Hurry and take him there! If
     someone discovers Raikov's dead body, you won't be able to disguise 
     yourself as him anymore. That means you won't be able to sneak into the
     west wing, either. And if that happens, you failed your mission. Take
     Raikov's dead body somewhere where you're sure it won't be found. OK?"

---

Snake: "EVA, about the escape plan..."
EVA: "Yeah, we're getting out on a WIG."
Snake: "The ground effect vehicle."
EVA: "Right. Here they call it an Ekranoplan."
Snake: "The Soviet Union has already finished testing one of those?"
EVA: "No, this is just the prototype given to GRU. It was designed to search
     out and destroy American submarines. That's why it has a long range, and a
     decent speed of 470 mph. It's far beyond the Be-1 developed three years
     ago. The problem for us is that the one here doesn't have any weapons
     onboard. If we're tailed, our only choice is to try and shake them. I'll
     leave that to you. Sorry if I won't have the time to play stewardess for
     you."

---

EVA: "OK, your Raikov disguise is complete. Now they won't stop you no matter
     what you do."
Snake: "Even if I punch someone in the face?"
EVA: "Right."
Snake: "Really?"
EVA: "Really."
Snake: "Why?"
EVA: "Raikov's just that kind of guy."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "Once you're disguised as Raikov, you can get into the west wing where
     Sokolov is being held. To get to the entrance to the west wing, pass west
     through the main wing of the weapons lab and go through the connecting
     passageway. You can get into the main wing of the weapons lab from the
     southwest side of the second floor. Head for the main wing."

---

EVA: "Don't worry about Raikov. No one will find him in the locker for a while.
     But when they do find him, your disguise will be useless. You won't be
     able to get into the west wing, and your mission will be a failure. So
     whatever you do, don't open the locker with Raikov in it. All right?"

Major Zero: "While you're dressed as Raikov, you can press the Action Button to
            perform a salute. If you want, why don't you try saluting some of
            the soldiers and scientists?"

---

Major Zero: "As long as you're Raikov, you'll be able to go anywhere in the
            fortress and no one will suspect a thing. Now may be a good time
            to do a little exploring around the place."

EVA: "By the way, Snake..."
Snake: "What?"
EVA: "Why aren't you eating it?"
Snake: "Eh? What are you talking about?"
EVA: "The instant noodles. Why aren't you eating them?"
Snake: "Do I have to?"
EVA: "Of course you do."
Snake: "Why?"
EVA: "Because it's a present from me."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "You probably didn't know, but instant noodles are really popular among
     the troops here at Groznyj Grad. It was really hard to get my hands on
     some. And I even managed to get you three whole packages..."
Snake: "Three? But you only gave me two..."
EVA: "Ah... Anyway, that's not the point. The point is - you'd better eat it.
     Or else."

Major Zero: "Snake!"
Snake: "...Major..."
Major Zero: "You're all right..."
Snake: "I wouldn't say all right...but at least I'm alive."
Para-Medic: "That's good enough..."
Snake: "But they took all my weapons and equipment from me."
Major Zero: "Well, you've still got your radio and medical items with you."
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "I wonder why that is?"
Major Zero: "Perhaps Volgin's not finished with you just yet."
Snake: "Yeah, well, I'm not finished with him yet, either."
Major Zero: "Snake, you've got to escape from that cell somehow. There must be
            a way. Use your head."

---

Major Zero: "The Boss gave you a gun?"
Snake: "Yeah. A Single Action Army."
Major Zero: "For what?"
Snake: "...I'm not sure."
Major Zero: "Hmm... Anyway, why don't you use that gun to shoot..."
Snake: "I can't."
Major Zero: "Why not?"
Snake: "No bullets."
Major Zero: "I see...well, you'll be able to get some once you're outside.
            First, you've got to escape from that cell. There must be a way.
            Don't give up."

---

Snake: "Major, I'm sorry... Sokolov, I couldn't..."
Major Zero: "Don't say it."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "You weren't able to rescue him. But that doesn't mean your mission
            has failed yet."
Snake: "EVA said they've completed Phase 2. There's no time left."
Major Zero: "You must destroy the Shagohod at all costs. ...That will be our
            final tribute to him."
Snake: "Right."

Para-Medic: "Snake, your right eye..."
Snake: "What about it?"
Para-Medic: "The cornea and the lens are severely damaged, and the eyeball is
            ruptured. So..."
Snake: "So I can't heal it even in the Survival Viewer."
Para-Medic: "I'm afraid not... I'm sorry, Snake. I wish there was something I
            could do..."
Snake: "Don't worry about it. I can still fight."
Para-Medic: "I don't doubt you. But don't do anything crazy, OK? From here on,
            it's going to be difficult to see out your right eye. Attacking in
            First Person View will feel a little different from before. Be
            careful."

---

Para-Medic: "You need to build up your stamina before trying to escape. Without
            your stamina, you won't have the strength to punch and kick. In any
            case, you've got to eat something to restore your stamina. That's
            an order!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, the door to the cell is set up open when it receives a radio
        signal on a certain frequency. If you only knew the frequency, you
        could use your radio to open the door..."

---

Sigint: "You say you're using a single action army? The single action army
        was first manufactured in 1873. It's been in production ever since
        then, except for a short hiatus. People started calling it the 
        'single action army' after the Army adopted it as their official
        sidearm in 1875. It's also sometimes called the 'Peacemaker,' owing
        to the fact that a lot of sheriffs used it to keep law and order in
        the old West. There are a lot of different models. The one you've 
        got is probably the 'Black Powder' model. The only thing is, it takes
        a while to reload. This is a gun with history. You can do all sorts
        of tricks with it. Why don't you practice with it for a while? Go into
        First Person View and use the right analog stick."

---

Sigint: "Snake, what's that you have in your hand?"
Snake: "A fork. Why?"
Sigint: "A fork? What'd you do with your knife? It ain't dinnertime yet!"
Snake: "Sigint, you have to think bigger than that. A fork's good for more
       than just eating dinner."
Sigint: "Oh yeah? Like what?"
Snake: "It's a weapon."
Sigint: "A weapon?"
Snake: "Yeah. I can use it with the Weapon Button the same way I use the
       survival knife. Of course, it's not going to be much use for CQC.
       This mission is all about procuring on site. I have to find whatever
       limited equipment I can find any way I can to achieve my objective.
       So, I have to make the most out of every item by adapting them to
       different situations. Take this fork, for instance. At first glance,
       it looks useless, but it can be an effective weapon if used the right
       way. You have to learn to think flexibly and see all the different
       possibilities."
Sigint: "Think flexibly, huh... Thanks for the advice, man."
Snake: "No problem. And the best part is, if I use this to spear a snack, I
       can eat it right there without having to put it in my backpack first."
Sigint: "...I knew it! You ARE using it to eat!"

EVA: "Snake, I wanted to ask you something..."
Snake: "What?"
EVA: "In the torture room, why did you protect me when Ocelot was about to
     fire?"
Snake: "Because I knew that the chamber wasn't empty and you'd be dead if he
       pulled the trigger."
EVA: "But your eye..."
Snake: "I was tied up and it happened so fast - it was the best I could do. I
       feel a little strange, but it won't interfere with the mission."
EVA: "What about me?"
Snake: "?"
EVA: "Did you only save me because I was important for completing your mission?
Snake: "What other reason would there be?"
EVA: "And when the mission is over?"
Snake: "Right now, it's just the mission."
EVA: "The 'mission' you used to love?"
Snake: "That's not what I mean."

[AFTER ESCAPING FROM THE JAIL CELL:]

Major Zero: "Snake, have you found any weapons?"
Snake: "I've got a fork."
Major Zero: "You call that a weapon...? Without a decent weapon, attacking the
            enemy head on is suicide. Until you get your gear back, your main
            focus should be staying out of sight. If by chance the enemy does
            see you, don't try to fight. Just run away. Got it?"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, you're really going to be cold with no clothes on."
Para-Medic: "The Major's right. You'll burn stamina a lot faster when you're
            naked. Be sure to eat regularly."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, now that you've lost even your CQC knife, you won't be able
            to use CQC. You won't be able to grab or throw enemies, either.
            You can still throw punches by pressing the CQC Button and launch
            combos by pressing it several times in a row. That'll have to do
            for now."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, now that all your clothing has been taken from you, you
            won't be able to camouflage yourself. Remember the basics of a
            sneaking mission. Stay out of the enemy's line of sight and proceed
            from one hiding spot to the next. Use caution."

Snake: "Major, I dug out the bullet The Boss shot into me..."
Major Zero: "Yes?"
Snake: "There was a fake death pill inside."
Major Zero: "Fake death pill?"
Snake: "Yeah. What does it mean...?"
Major Zero: "I haven't a clue. I wonder if it's meant to help you escape from
            the cell...?"
Snake: "You're saying The Boss was trying to help me? But why?"
Major Zero: "If you don't know, how am I supposed to know?"
Snake: "..."

Para-Medic: "Snake, without any decent weapons, you'll just get yourself
            injured in a fight. You don't have enough medical items, either.
            Forget about fighting and just run. Okay?"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, do you have any clothes?"
Snake: "Not yet."
Para-Medic: "So you're still naked?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Para-Medic: "When you don't have any clothes on, your body loses heat quickly.
            That makes you burn stamina a lot faster. Make sure you keep
            eating. It doesn't need to be clothes. Anything you have that can
            cover you up should help you conserve stamina..."

---

EVA: "Without weapons or equipment, you're not going to be able to continue
     your mission. I've got all your belongings with me. Let's meet up outside
     the fortress. There's an open manhole in the northwestern section of the
     fortress. You can use it to get down into the sewers and make your way out
     of Groznyj Grad. To get to the manhole, go under the passageway leading to
     the west wing and head north. It won't be long before Volgin and his men
     notice you're gone. Get to the manhole before they find you."

Snake: "EVA, what happened to Ocelot?"
EVA: "Can't get enough of him, huh?"
Snake: "He doesn't trust you."
EVA: "I know. So it's me you're worried about, then?"
Snake: "EVA..."

            head north. Enemy search patrols are already headed your way. Don't
            just stand there. Run!"

---

Para-Medic: "The enemy has sent attack dogs after you. You won't stand a
            chance against them in your present state. Just keep running
            north! You might be able to distract the attack dogs by throwing
            food at them. Give it a shot!"

---

EVA: "Snake, forgive me. The escape route I set up has been cut off. They've
     already sent units out to hunt you down. And they've got attack dogs with
     them... There's a way out of the sewers to the north. Head north as fast
     as you can!"

---

EVA: "There's no way to get past the iron gates blocking the passageways. But
     there are a lot of side ducts connecting the passageway together. Crawl
     through those ducts to get around the gates."

---

EVA: "Snake, watch out. The search party has released attack dogs into the 
     sewers. Without any decent weapons, it's too dangerous to take those dogs
     on in a fight. Don't even think about fighting the attack dogs. Your only
     concern right now is to get away. Head north!"

Major Zero: "The waterfall where EVA said she'd meet you is up ahead to the
            north. Head that direction."

Major Zero: "Snake."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "Snake!"
Snake: "Wh-what...oh, Major...What do you want?"
Major Zero: "What happened? You've been acting strangely ever since you were
            washed down the river."
Snake: "I'm fine."
Major Zero: "I disagree."
Snake: "Really?
Major Zero: "Yes."
Snake: "..."
Major Zero: "Did something happen to you in that river?"
Snake: "No..."
Major Zero: "Don't lie, Snake. I'm trying to help you."
Snake: "...All right. But you might not believe me when I tell you."
Major Zero: "I'll believe it. I trust you."
Snake: "Ok, then. When I was in that river..."
Major Zero: "Yes?"
Snake: "I saw...the other side."
Major Zero: "The other side?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "...And by the other side, you mean...?"
Snake: "Well, the world of the dead...I guess."
Major Zero: "..."
Snake: "And The Sorrow was there. He was sad...no, more than that. He said I
       was part of his sorrow..."
Major Zero: "I...see...um, Snake, would you excuse me for a moment?"
Snake: "Huh? Sure..."
[Snake can hear Zero talking to Para-Medic.]
Major Zero: "Para-Medic, what in the hell is wrong with Snake?"
Para-Medic: "Beats me... Maybe he got a nasty bump on the head."
Major Zero: "...You really think that's all?"
Para-Medic: "What are you implying?" 
Snake: "Major?"
Major Zero: "I mean, he's always been a little bit...different... I thought
            maybe..."
Para-Medic: "Good point... I was just thinking that myself."
Snake: "MAJOR!"
Major Zero: "Wh--what is it, Snake?"
Snake: "I can hear you."
Major Zero: "!! W...well, in any case, I'm glad you're all right."
Para-Medic: "Y...yeah. Me, too. It's good to see you're back to ah...normal..."
Snake: "..."

EVA: "That area is known as Tikhogornyj. It means 'the tranquil mountain ridge'
     in Russian. Like the name says, it's the most beautiful riverbank in the
     region of Groznyj Grad. If you go upstream, you'll come to a waterfall.
     I'll meet you in the cave behind that waterfall. Make your way up the
     river."

52) Tikhogornyj: Behind Waterfall
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, I see you've recovered your weapons and equipment."
Snake: "Now I can finally go on the offensive."
Major Zero: "Time to pay Volgin back for what he did to you."
Snake: "Yeah. And then some."
Major Zero: "But first you've got to destroy the Shagohod. The Shagohod is in
            the hangar in the main wing of the weapons lab. Go back to Groznyj
            Grad, amke your way into the hangar, and destroy the Shagohod. You
            can get back into Groznyj Grad by going to the end of the cave
            behind the waterfall. Head back to Groznyj Grad."

Major Zero: "Huh? Snake, take a look in your backpack."
Snake: "What the... My food's gone! Major!! What the hell is going on here!?"
Major Zero: "Don't ask me. Ask EVA."
Snake: "EVA...!"

---

Major Zero: "The Cynthia that EVA mentioned was a famous lady spy who worked
            for Britain during the Second World War. Her real name was Amy
            Elizabeth Thorpe. She was a lovely, intelligent woman, and she used
            those charms as a weapon to extract numerous secrets from the
            enemy. They say her most brilliant achievement was getting the 
            French Vichy government's naval ciphers. But don't let yourself be
            taken in by EVA's charms."
Snake: "I'll be careful."

---

Major Zero: "'I'll be your eyes'... ...makes me want to cry."
Snake: "Why's that?"
Major Zero: "It reminds me of something a certain spy once said. His name was
            Oleg Penkovsky, a Western spy who worked inside GRU. He was
            arrested by the KGB and executed last year. They say he sent a
            letter to the DCI at the time, saying, 'I must remain on this front
            line in order to be your eyes and ears.' His code name was 'Hero.'"
Snake: "A hero whose name will never be known."
Major Zero: "Yes. That's the world we live in."

Sigint: "That idea Sokolov had of planting C3 on the liquid fuel tanks...not a
        bad idea. The fuel he was referring to is probably UDMH - unsymmetrical
        dimethyl hydrazine. It's highly flammable, but difficult to handle. If
        you can blow it all up at once with C3, it'll take the entire weapons
        lab out with it, no doubt. But that's only if you manage to plant the
        C3 in the right place on each tank. So don't screw it up.

---

Sigint: "Eh? That's some bizarre camo you got on, Snake..."
Snake: "It's spirit camo... I think it was a gift from The Sorrow."
Sigint: "The Sorrow? But he's been... Man, I don't even want to know. Anyway,
        that camouflage seems to have some kind of special power. When you're
        wearing it and grab an enemy using CQC, you can drain stamina out of
        the enemy while choking him. And you don't make a sound when you move
        around."
Snake: "Sounds good."
Sigint: "...Tell me the truth. Did you really get that from The Sorrow?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Sigint: "...Hell, the major says he's been abducted by a UFO, so why not...?"
Snake: "???"

---

Sigint: "Snake, what's that face paint you're wearing?"
Snake: "Kabuki."
Sigint: "Kabuki?"
Snake: "Right. It's used in traditional Japanese theater. Apparently, it gives
       whoever's wearing it some kind of mystical power."
Sigint: "Get out of here."
Snake: "That's what I heard."
Sigint: "From who?"
Snake: "Para-Medic."
Sigint: "Figures. Well, wahtever it does, it doesn't make very good camouflage.
Snake: "Really?"
Sigint: "Yeah. You should switch to another kind of paint."
Snake: "But I was just starting to like it..."
Sigint: "..."

===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, you've got to destroy the Shagohod. It's located in the
            hangar in the main wing of the weapons lab. To get to the hangar,
            use the door just inside the main wing as you enter it from the
            second floor of the east wing. Start out by heading for the east
            wing of the weapons lab."

---

Sigint: "Hey, those tanks look like Object 279s."
Snake: "Object 279s?"
Sigint: "Yup. We don't have a lot of details yet, but apparently they're a kind
        of heavy tank designed to operate in situations involving the use of
        tactical nuclear weapons. They're distinguished by two sets of double
        treads and a disk-shaped shield, which keeps it from being flipped over
        in a nuclear blast. Basically, the four treads widen the traction area
        and increase friction with the ground, while the disk-shaped shield
        deflects the blast above and below the vehicle. The tank is armed with
        a 130 mm cannon. It's also got a 1000 horsepower diesel engine, which
        gives it a decent top speed. As far as we knew, it hadn't been formally
        adopted because of the high cost of production...but it looks like we
        were wrong. Anyway, those don't seem to be ready for deployment yet. 
        You don't need to worry about them going anywhere. Just keep moving."

EVA: "The Shagohod is in the hangar of the main wing of the weapons lab. You
     can get into the hangar through the door located at the entrance to the
     main wing on the second floor of the east wing. Hurry!"

---

Snake: "EVA, didn't you take a picture of me when I was about to leave the
       waterfall cave?"
EVA: "Oh, that. That's a button-shaped hidden camera developed by the KGB. I
     use it to take pictures of the fortress and the Shagohod and..."
Snake: "That's not what I wanted to know. Why did you take a picture of me?"
EVA: "Because I wanted a picture of you."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "...If I told you why, would you believe me anyway?"
Snake: "..."

---

EVA: "Snake, they know you disguised yourself as Raikov to get in last time.
     And besides, you lost the hat, so I don't think the disguise is going to
     work anymore."

---

EVA: "The only way for you to sneak into the weapons lab is through the
     entrance. Speaking of which, I sometimes see trucks going in and out
     through there. If you can sneak onto one of those trucks somehow..."

---

Snake: "EVA, remember how you said today was a day of rest for the scientists
       in the hangar?"
EVA: "Yeah."
Snake: "What did you mean by that?"
EVA: "Until yesterday, there were tons of scientists and maintanance personnel
     working in the hangar. But because Volgin was forcing them to work day and
     night, a lot of the scientists were collapsing from exhaustion. So now 
     that the prototype is finished and things are a little less hectic, they
     gave the scientists a day to rest."
Snake: "I see."
EVA: "If they were still working like that, it would have been impossible for
     you to sneak into the hangar. But this doesn't mean the hangar is 
     completely deserted. I'm pretty sure there are still a few guards and
     maintenance personnel left. Stay alert."

Snake: "EVA..."
EVA: "What's up?"
Snake: "About our escape plan..."
EVA: "Uh huh..."
Snake: "How exactly are you planning to get to the lake?"
EVA: "What, don't you trust me?"
Snake: "That's not what I meant."
EVA: "OK, then. I'll explain it to you. To the north of Groznyjgrad [sic], 
     there's a forest called Lazorevo. The name Lazorevo means 'the lush green
     earth.' On the other side of Lazorevo is a large forest called Zaozyorje.
     Zaozyorje means 'near the lake' in Russian. The lake is just beyond
     Zaozyorje. And the name of that lake is Rokovoj Bereg, 'the lake of
     destiny.'"
Snake: "That's where you hid the WIG?"
EVA: "Yeah. We'll use it to make our getaway. Once we've completed our
     missions, that is."

Snake: "EVA, that Shagohod data you got from Sokolov..."
EVA: "Uh huh..."
Snake: "Are you really going to give it to Khrushchev?"
EVA: "You think I'm going to answer that?"
Snake: "I know I want you to answer me."
EVA: "You're asking for something I can't give you."
Snake: "..."
EVA: "Snake, I have a mission to carry out, just like you. Please, try to
     understand..."
Snake: "..."

---

EVA: "The name of Groznyj Grad means 'the terrible fortress.' And that's 
     exactly what it is - an impregnable monster of a fortress built using
     Colonel Volgin's enormous fortune. In the center of the fortress is a
     weapons lab that acts as the nerve center of the place. In the southeast
     there's a prison, in the northwest there's an armory, and in the northeast
     there's a provisions storehouse. The weapons lab in the center is where
     Granin, Sokolov, and their fellow scientists carry out their high-tech
     weapons research. The flying platform and attack chopper you saw are two
     of their accomplishments. And now they're about to finish the work on the
     Shagohod. They call it 'the terrible fortress' for a reason."

EVA: "Snake, don't forget about our dinner."
Snake: "I haven't forgotten. Sushi, right... I want to try the Otton frog."
EVA: "The what?"
Snake: "The Otton frog."
EVA: "Frog!?"
Snake: "They have frog at sushi bars, don't they?"
EVA: "Of course not!"
Snake: "But I heard they at frogs as sashimi and tempura over in Japan."
EVA: "Who told you that?"
Snake: "Para-Medic."
EVA: "...I suppose they eat frogs on certain occassions. But not normally, and
     certainly not as sushi."
Snake: "Oh... OK."

Snake: "EVA, about the contents of my backpack you got for me..."
EVA: "Is there something missing?"
Snake: "Yeah, all of my food."
EVA: "Well, how strange..."
Snake: "You didn't..."
EVA: "It wasn't me!"
Snake: "..."
EVA: "All those snakes and crocodiles and suspicious-looking mushrooms... I 
     wouldn't eat that stuff even if you paid me!"
Snake: "What about the instant noodles?"
EVA: "..."
Snake: "EVA..."
EVA: "I was hungry, OK!? Give me a break! It's just a little packet of
     noodles..."
Snake: "It wasn't just the noodles. All those animals I worked so hard to
       capture..."
EVA: "That wasn't me."
Snake: "So who was it?"
EVA: "It was Ocelot."
Snake: "Ocelot?"
EVA: "He said he wanted to eat the same things you did."
Snake: "Why would he do that?"
EVA: "You haven't figured it out?"
Snake: "No."
EVA: "You are dense."
Snake: "...???"

Snake: "EVA, about this explosive..."
EVA: "The C3?"
Snake: "Yeah. Wasn't this stuff developed in the United States?"
EVA: "That's right."
Snake: "So where did you get it?"
EVA: "There's a vault full of Western weapons used for research purposes."
Snake: "And you stole it from there?"
EVA: "Yep."
Snake: "How? A vault full of secret Western technology should be under strict
       surveillance."
EVA: "You really want to know?"
Snake: "Yeah."
EVA: "Really?"
Snake: "Yes."
EVA: "Well, I'm not telling anyway."
Snake: "Why not?"
EVA: "It'd be a waste of time."
Snake: "A waste of time?"
EVA: "Even if I explained how I did it, you'd never be able to do it yourself."
Snake: "What does that mean?"
EVA: "Exactly what it sounds like."

Sigint: "Those are some funky clothes you're wearing."
Snake: "Yeah. It's called a sneaking suit."
Sigint: "Sneaking suit? What's that all about?"
Snake: "I'm not sure, but it looks like what The Boss was wearing..."
Sigint: "Huh. Well, whatever it is, it's a fine piece of work. The suit seems
        to be made of some kind of special bulletproof fiber. Wearing it should
        reduce all the damage you take by half. The waterproofing and head and
        moisture insulation are top-notch. Just having it on you will reduce
        the amount of stamina you burn. It even increases your overall Camo
        Index. You got yourself a keeper, Snake."
Snake: "Yeah. Maybe we should make it the official uniform of FOX."

---

Sigint: "You're wearing Raikov's uniform? But the enemy already knows you
        disguised yourself as him, and on top of that, you lost your cap. I
        don't think that disguise is going to fool anyone anymore. Besides,
        that uniform doesn't have any camouflage patterns, so your Camo Index
        is going to be low. Don't you think you'd be better off wearing some
        other kind of gear?"

---

Sigint: "You're wearing a maintenance crew uniform? With the maintenance crew
        uniform on, you can pretend you're one of the workers assigned to the
        Shagohod hangar. But there aren't any maintenance personnel around
        there. All that outfit's going to do is make you stand out. I'd change
        into something else if I were you."

56) Groznyj Grad Weapons Lab: Main Wing
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, your job is to plant the C3 charges on the liquid fuel
            tanks. There are four liquid fuel tanks. You need to place a C3
            charge on each of them. The tanks should all be located close to
            the Shagohod."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, be careful when you approach the liquid fuel tanks.
            Apparently even the slightest disturbance will cause them to 
            explode. Don't use firearms near the tanks."

---

EVA: "It looks like you made it inside the hangar, huh. Plant the C3 charges
     on the liquid fuel tanks. There are four tanks in all. If one of the C3
     charges you planted is dismantled by the enemy, your mission is over. Try
     to plant the C3 someplace out of the way where it won't be seen. If it
     looks like an enemy is about to find a charge, take him down immediately.
     And if the enemy sees you planting the C3, show's over, folks. So don't
     plant the charges in Alert Phase. Got it? Once you've finished planting C3
     on all four tanks, turn the timer on. When the count reaches zero, all of
     the C3 charges will explode at once. Once the timer has started, there's
     no way to stop it. Make sure you're out of there by the time it reaches
     zero, got it?"

---

EVA: "The maintenance crew in charge of getting the Shagohod ready is in the
     hangar. You don't want them to see you any more than you want the guards
     to. So keep an eye out for them."

Snake: "Major."
Major Zero: "Snake, are you all right!?"
Snake: "Yeah."
Major Zero: "The explosion went off successfully."
Snake: "Yeah, but the hangar is still standing."
Sigint: "The explosion was smaller than what we had hoped for because the fuel
        tanks didn't catch on fire."
Snake: "But the fuel tanks were definitely..."
Sigint: "Remember how the enemy spotted the C3 while you were busy with Volgin?
        They must have called in the EOD to remove the fuel from the tanks
        then. But still, the C3 alone should've been enough to take out the
        manufacturing line. That'll probably be the last one they'll ever make.
        You succeeded in prventing its mass production."
Major Zero: "Snake, if you can take out the Shagohod that Volgin is in, the
            world will be safe from that monstrosity of a weapon. But you won't
            to [sic] be able to take it down with the weapons you have on you.
            You have to come up with something else. It's time to rethink your
            plan off attack. First, get out of there. You need to shake your
            pursuers. Snake, leave the driving to EVA. You concentrate on
            fending off your pursuers and clearing the way for her. Don't worry
            about running out of ammunition - the sidecar seems to be loaded
            with plenty of it. Use First Person View to eliminate your
            attackers!

---

Major Zero: "The enemy will be coming at you from all sides - front and back,
            left and right. Use First Person View to take them out. Listen
            closely to what EVA tells you!"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, your ultimate objective is to escape. There's no need to
            defeat every last enemy. Rather than attacking the enemies you've
            put behind you, focus on dispatching the ones that are blocking the
            way in front of you."

---

Major Zero: "Watch out for those guard towers. You don't want them sniping at
            you from above. If you see an enemy in one of the guard towers,
            take him out first!"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, keep an eye on EVA's LIFE as well. If she is killed, you're
            finished. Make sure you dont shoot EVA by mistake!"

---

Major Zero: "You can blow up the drums placed throughout the fortress by
            shooting them. That should trip the enemy up a bit. Aim for the
            drums!"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, the enemy is hot in pursuit. If they catch up to you, 
            you're dead! You've got to get away from them!!"

---

Para-Medic: "While you're riding in the sidecar, lying down won't cause your
            LIFE to recover gradually like usual. If you need to restore LIFE,
            use the LIFE medicine!"

Sigint: "Snake, leave the driving to EVA and focus on attacking. Use First
        Person View to pick off the enemies around you."

[AFTER SEEING OCELOT SCENES:]

Snake: "Major, we're about to head for the rail bridge."
Major Zero: "So I heard. You're going to take out the bridge and the Shagohod
            with it, eh? Nice plan. Let EVA do the driving. Concentrate on 
            fending off your pursuers. You've got to make it to that bridge
            somehow!"

---

Major Zero: "It looks like the Shagohod's fallen quite far behind. You're in
            the barracks area now. In just a few moments, you'll come upon
            Groznyj Grad's northern runway. Keep going! You're almost there!"

===============================================================================
58) Groznyj Grad Runway
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Good, you've reached the runway. The rail bridge is just up ahead.
            You've got to hold on until you reach the bridge!"

---

Sigint: "If you've got a sidecar on your tail, you should take out the enemy
        in the side seat first. That'll take a big chunk out of its firepower."

===============================================================================
59) Groznyj Grad Rail Bridge
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, when the Shagohod approaches the bridge, that's your cue
            to start sniping the C3 bombs planted on the struts. Use the SVD.
            The C3 bombs are planted on the support beams on the front center
            side of the bridge. Concentrate on your target. You must destroy
            the bridge before the Shagohod makes it across!"

---

Major Zero: "You'll be crushed if the Shagohod makes it across the bridge. On
            the other hand, if you blow it up too early, the plan will be a
            failure. Wait until the Shagohod is on top of the rail bridge to 
            shoot the C3 bombs and destroy it."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, you have to shoot all those C3 charges before the Shagohod
            gets across the bridge. Aim carefully! You can take pentazemin to
            keep your hands from shaking."

---

Sigint: "Snake, snipe the C3 bombs planted on the rail bridge to blow it up.
        Normally, C3 is a chemically stable material. It's only when it
        receives a shock from the outside that it turns into an explosive.
        EVA's probably set those bombs up with detonators so they go off when
        they're disturbed by something. She must have done it to prevent them
        from being disarmed. Man, she thought of everything. Shooting those C3
        bombs should set off the detonators and take the bridge down. Either
        the SVD or the RPG-7 would be good for this job. If you're really a
        hot shot, you can use an assault rifle or a handgun, too. Just don't
        let me catch you using a tranquilizer gun. Clear your mind and focus
        on making the shot."

[DURING SHAGOHOD FIGHT:]

Major Zero: "Snake, the rear frame of the Shagohod was destroyed when the
            bridge collapsed. The backside of the front frame is now exposed.
            Even the Shagohod is bound to have less armor plating on its
            backside. I'm sure you can penetrate it with the RPG-7. Attack
            the Shagohod from behind with the RPG-7!"

---

Major Zero: "The area around the Shagohod's underbody seems to have sustained
            heavy damage as well. By hitting its base with the RPG-7 or a
            grenade, you can force it to change direction. That will surely
            make it easier to get behind it. Aim for the base!"

---

Para-Medic: "The Shagohod's weapons are deadly. You're likely to get seriously
            hurt if you get caught in its sights. If you get injured, go into
            the Survival Viewer and take care of it immediately!"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, pay attention to EVA's LIFE gauge. Make sure you don't
            attack her by mistake!"

---

Sigint: "The machine gun on that thing is deadly. But you can force him to
        break off his attack by firing the RPG-7 at the body of the Shagohod.
        If he starts strafing you with the machine gun, pump a rocket into the
        Shagohod before you get turned into Swiss cheese."

---

Sigint: "The armor on that thing is rock solid, but you can compromise it if
        you hit it with a rocket to the inside. Every time he uses the heavy
        machine gun, the armor cover opens up. Aim for that opening!"

---

Sigint: "The Shagohod's missiles are radio-guided. You can disable the guidance
        system with a chaff grenade. Try it out! If it's too late to use chaff,
        shoot it down with your gun. I know that sounds kind of crazy, but if
        anyone can do it, you can!"

---

Sigint: "When he rams into you with that drill, he's got a lot of weight behind
        him. It does serious damage. If the Shagohod tries to ram you, shoot it
        with the RPG-7 to trip it up!"

60) Groznyj Grad Rail Bridge North
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, you've got to make it to the lake! Leave the driving to
            EVA like before. And stay vigilant. The enemy is still in pursuit!"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, you've got to make it to the lake somehow. She's...waiting
            for you."
Snake: "I know."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, you're almost to the lake. Hold on just a little longer!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, don't let the enemy catch up to you! Use First Person View to
        pick 'em off!!"

===============================================================================
61) Lazorevo South
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Watch out for the flying platforms, too. You can't afford to have
            them shooting at you from the air. Don't let them get too close, or
            else!"

===============================================================================
62) Lazorevo North
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, you must shoot the fallen logs and branches that block your
            path. Follow EVA's instructions!"

---

Major Zero: "Snake, the engine seems to have caught fire."
Snake: "We're almost out of fuel, too. But it only needs to get us to the lake.
       Just a little further."
Major Zero: "Hang in there."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, you're almost to the lake. Hold on just a little longer!"

===============================================================================
63) Zaozyorje West
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, are you all right?"
Snake: "I've been better."
Para-Medic: "What about EVA?"
Snake: "I healed her up. She can manage."
Para-Medic: "Good..."
Major Zero: "Snake, stay on your toes. The enemy hasn't given up coming after
            you yet. They should be there any minute now. If you go southeast
            from there, you'll come to a road leading to the lake. Take EVA
            with you and head southeast."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, you'll take the lead and break through the enemy's line of
            defense. EVA will ordinarily be following behind you. If you lie on
            your belly, she'll lie down as well. If you slip and fall off a
            cliff, she'll follow right behind. You can call out to EVA by 
            pressing the Action Button. Head to the lake along with EVA."
Para-Medic: "You've given her treatment, but EVA is still badly injured. Don't
            stray too far from her side. If you get too far apart, she might
            just sit down and refuse to move. Make sure EVA stays with you on
            your way to the lake."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, what do you think you're doing? The enemy search party will
            be there any minute. Head to the southeast, quickly!"

---

Para-Medic: "You can treat EVA's wounds by selecting 'EVA' from the 'CURE'
            screen in the Survival Viewer. If she gets injured, see to her
            right away. Got it?"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, don't forget about EVA's stamina. She'll collapse from
            exhaustion if she runs out. If EVA's stamina starts to run low, go
            into the Survival Viewer and give her something to eat. To give her
            food to eat, select a food item from 'FOOD' and press the Enter
            Button, then select 'EVA'. But don't give her anything rotten or
            poisonous!"

---

[If you try to exit Zaozyorge West without Eva:]
Major Zero: "Snake, the lake is just over that cliff. EVA should be able to
            climb it if you help her. Keep her close to you."

---

Para-Medic: "You and EVA are both exhausted. You need to take it easy. If you
            find a good place to hide, like tree hollows or bushes, lie low and
            let your LIFE recover. Got it?"

---

Para-Medic: "I see it's started to rain. You burn through stamina a lot faster
            when it's raining. It'll also reduce your visual range and make it
            more difficult to sense where the enemy is. Be careful."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, your escape is going to be a test of endurance. If you find
            edible plants or animals, be sure to catch enough for EVA to eat,
            too."

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, the lake is just up ahead! You can make it!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, you're almost to the lake. You can make it, man!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, you and EVA are both in real bad shape. I wouldn't be thinking
        about taking the enemy on in an all-out fight if I were you. It's time
        to start laying some traps. Set up a trap the right way and you can
        stop an enemy in his tracks. And that'll buy you some time. Use TNT and
        Claymores to give them a hard time."

---

Sigint: "You don't have to beat all the guys that are after you. The only thing
        you need to worry about is getting away in one piece. Smoke grenades
        and stun grenades might not cause any damage, but they're pretty good
        at slowing people down."

===============================================================================
64) Zaozyorje East
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, the lake is in the northeast of that area. You're almost
            here. Head to the northeast, and don't forget EVA."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, if the enemy catches out of you, stop where you are and
            fight them off. However, there's no need to defeat them all. As
            soon as you've beaten them back, continue on toward the lake."

---

Major Zero: "Snake, The Boss is waiting for you at the lake."
Snake: "I know."
Major Zero: "That's all I can tell you. Finish the mission, Snake."
Snake: "... Yeah."

===============================================================================
65) Rokojov Bereg [The Boss Battle]
===============================================================================

Major Zero: "Snake, it's time to complete your final mission. This is where you
            fulfill your loyalty to your country - and perhaps to her as well.
            You must defeat The Boss! The firepower of that Patriot pistol The
            Boss is using is beyond compare. In a straight shoot-out, you'll
            lose every time. Your first comcern should be to hide yourself 
            while using camouflage. Maneuver towards The Boss' blind side, wait
            for an opening, and attack her with a gun or CQC."

---

Major Zero: "Watch out for The Boss' Patriot pistol. Any attack you make is
            going to be futile in the face of such overwhelming firepower.
            Attack her from the back or side. Use your camouflage to sneak
            into her blind spot!"

---

Major Zero: "You can also crawl through the flowers in Intrusion View. Use this
            technique to maneuver discreetly into The Boss' blind spot. In 
            First Person View, you can press the Left and Right Step Buttons
            simultaneously to prop yourself up. That way, you can keep track of
            The Boss' position as you move. The motion detector and active
            sonar will also prove useful. Sneak behind The Boss so that she
            remains unaware of your position."

---

Major Zero: "In a proximity encounter, The Boss will obviously try to use CQC
            on you. By pressing the CQC Button at the very moment The Boss
            launches a CQC strike, you can parry the attack. If you're
            successful, you can maneuver around to her side. That's your
            chance to use CQC on her. But if you fail, not only will she throw
            you, but she'll disassemble your weapon as well. Watch The Boss'
            movements carefully. Timing is everything!"

---

Major Zero: "The Boss has ordered MiGs to launch an air strike. If you don't
            finish the battle within 10 minutes, you'll both be blown to bits.
            You must defeat The Boss before the MiGs get there!"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, it's all over if you lose sight of The Boss. Don't let
            those falling flower petals confuse you!"

---

Para-Medic: "The Boss is human just like you and me. If she gets distracted,
            she's sure to leave herself open to attack. Try throwing a magazine
            or a captured animal and see what happens!"

---

Sigint: "That gun The Boss is using is a one-of-a-kind sidearm she had made
        especially for her. They call it the 'Patriot.' Basically, they took
        the Army's experimental XM16E1, cut the barrel short, and took off the
        stock. It handles like a handgun, but it's got the stopping power of a
        rifle. Because the barrel is cut so short, it's got some nasty recoil
        though. I can't believe she's using it with one hand! Now I see why
        she's the leader of the Cobras and a legendary hero. As long as The
        Boss is firing that Patriot at you, frontal attacks are going to be
        useless. Get around to her back or side and attack her from there. 
        Move!"

---

Sigint: "If The Boss gets you with a CQC attack, there's a chance she'll
        disassemble whatever weapon you've got equipped at the time. The
        disassembled weapon will turn into Item Boxes and scatter throughout
        the area. Try to recover them right away."

---

Sigint: "One tactic you might want to try is blinding her with a stun grenade
        or a smoke grenade. While she's lost sight of you, move around to her
        side or back and attack her!"

---

Sigint: "Snake, move through the flower field so The Boss can't see you, and
        try to get behind her. Use the active sonar or the motion detector to
        figure out her position. But keep an eye on the batteries!"

---

Sigint: "So The Boss called in the MiGs? The MiGs The Boss called in are
        probably MiG-21s, a Soviet front line fighter. They can be equipped
        with rocket pods and bombs for air-to-ground attacks. If the MiGs dump
        napalm on you, you can kiss your ass goodbye. You gotta beat The Boss
        before that happens!"

EVA: [NO RESPONSE]

Major Zero: "Snake, pick up one of the Item Boxes on the floor. One of them
            contains a loaded revolver. My bet's on you, Snake! Pick up the
            gun!!"

---

Para-Medic: "Snake, pick up the gun already! Trust your instincts!"

Sigint: "It's too late to back out now, Snake! Pick up the gun!"
